The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s.
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!
your anointing oils are fragrant;
 Draw me after you; let us run.
I am very dark, but lovely,
Do not gaze at me because I am dark,
Tell me, you whom my soul loves,
If you do not know,
I compare you, my love,
 Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments,
We will make for you ornaments of gold,
While the king was on his couch,
My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh
My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms
 Behold, you are beautiful, my love;
Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, truly delightful.
the beams of our house are cedar;
I am a rose of Sharon,
As a lily among brambles,
As an apple tree among the trees of the forest,
He brought me to the banqueting house,
Sustain me with raisins;
His left hand is under my head,
I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
The voice of my beloved!
My beloved is like a gazelle
My beloved speaks and says to me:
for behold, the winter is past;
 The flowers appear on the earth,
 The fig tree ripens its figs,
O my dove, in the clefts of the rock,
Catch the foxes for us,
 My beloved is mine, and I am his;
Until the day breathes
On my bed by night
I will rise now and go about the city,
 The watchmen found me
Scarcely had I passed them
 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
 What is that coming up from the wilderness
Behold, it is the litter of Solomon!
all of them wearing swords
King Solomon made himself a carriage
He made its posts of silver,
Go out, O daughters of Zion,
Behold, you are beautiful, my love,
Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes
Your lips are like a scarlet thread,
Your neck is like the tower of David,
Your two breasts are like two fawns,
 Until the day breathes
 You are altogether beautiful, my love;
 Come with me from Lebanon, my bride;
You have captivated my heart, my sister, my bride;
How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!
Your lips drip nectar, my bride;
A garden locked is my sister, my bride,
Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates
nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon,
a garden fountain, a well of living water,
Awake, O north wind,
I came to my garden, my sister, my bride,
I slept, but my heart was awake.
 I had put off my garment;
My beloved put his hand to the latch,
I arose to open to my beloved,
I opened to my beloved,
 The watchmen found me
I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
What is your beloved more than another beloved,
My beloved is radiant and ruddy,
His head is the finest gold;
His eyes are like doves
His cheeks are like beds of spices,
His arms are rods of gold,
His legs are alabaster columns,
His mouth is most sweet,
Where has your beloved gone,
My beloved has gone down to his garden
 I am my beloved’s and my beloved is mine;
You are beautiful as Tirzah, my love,
Turn away your eyes from me,
 Your teeth are like a flock of ewes
 Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate
There are sixty queens and eighty concubines,
My dove, my perfect one, is the only one,
 “Who is this who looks down like the dawn,
I went down to the nut orchard
 Before I was aware, my desire set me
  Return, return, O Shulammite,
How beautiful are your feet in sandals,
Your navel is a rounded bowl
 Your two breasts are like two fawns,
Your neck is like an ivory tower.
Your head crowns you like Carmel,
 How beautiful and pleasant you are,
Your stature is like a palm tree,
I say I will climb the palm tree
and your mouth like the best wine.
 I am my beloved’s,
 Come, my beloved,
let us go out early to the vineyards
 The mandrakes give forth fragrance,
Oh that you were like a brother to me
I would lead you and bring you
 His left hand is under my head,
I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
 Who is that coming up from the wilderness,
Set me as a seal upon your heart,
Many waters cannot quench love,
We have a little sister,
If she is a wall,
 I was a wall,
Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon;
My vineyard, my very own, is before me;
 O you who dwell in the gardens,
 Make haste, my beloved,
