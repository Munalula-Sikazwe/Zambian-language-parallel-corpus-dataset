 The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet saw.
O Lord, how long shall I cry for help,
 Why do you make me see iniquity,
 So the law is paralyzed,
 “Look among the nations, and see;
For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans,
They are dreaded and fearsome;
 Their horses are swifter than leopards,
They all come for violence,
At kings they scoff,
Then they sweep by like the wind and go on,
Are you not from everlasting,
You who are of purer eyes than to see evil
You make mankind like the fish of the sea,
 He brings all of them up with a hook;
 Therefore he sacrifices to his net
Is he then to keep on emptying his net
I will take my stand at my watchpost
And the Lord answered me:
For still the vision awaits its appointed time;
“Behold, his soul is puffed up; it is not upright within him,
“Moreover, wine is a traitor,
Shall not all these take up their taunt against him, with scoffing and riddles for him, and say,
 Will not your debtors suddenly arise,
 Because you have plundered many nations,
 “Woe to him who gets evil gain for his house,
You have devised shame for your house
For the stone will cry out from the wall,
 “Woe to him who builds a town with blood
Behold, is it not from the Lord of hosts
 For the earth will be filled
 “Woe to him who makes his neighbors drink—
You will have your fill of shame instead of glory.
 The violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you,
 “What profit is an idol
 Woe to him who says to a wooden thing, Awake;
But the Lord is in his holy temple;
A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to Shigionoth.
O Lord, I have heard the report of you,
God came from Teman,
 His brightness was like the light;
 Before him went pestilence,
He stood and measured the earth;
I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction;
 Was your wrath against the rivers, O Lord?
You stripped the sheath from your bow,
 The mountains saw you and writhed;
 The sun and moon stood still in their place
 You marched through the earth in fury;
 You went out for the salvation of your people,
You pierced with his own arrows the heads of his warriors,
 You trampled the sea with your horses,
 I hear, and my body trembles;
Though the fig tree should not blossom,
 yet I will rejoice in the Lord;
 God, the Lord, is my strength;
