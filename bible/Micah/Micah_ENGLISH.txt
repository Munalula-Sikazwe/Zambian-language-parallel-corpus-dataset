The word of the Lord that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
 Hear, you peoples, all of you;
For behold, the Lord is coming out of his place,
And the mountains will melt under him,
All this is for the transgression of Jacob
Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the open country,
All her carved images shall be beaten to pieces,
 For this I will lament and wail;
 For her wound is incurable,
 Tell it not in Gath;
Pass on your way,
For the inhabitants of Maroth
Harness the steeds to the chariots,
Therefore you shall give parting gifts
I will again bring a conqueror to you,
 Make yourselves bald and cut off your hair,
 Woe to those who devise wickedness
They covet fields and seize them,
Therefore thus says the Lord:
In that day they shall take up a taunt song against you
Therefore you will have none to cast the line by lot
 “Do not preach”—thus they preach—
Should this be said, O house of Jacob?
But lately my people have risen up as an enemy;
The women of my people you drive out
 Arise and go,
If a man should go about and utter wind and lies,
I will surely assemble all of you, O Jacob;
 He who opens the breach goes up before them;
And I said:
you who hate the good and love the evil,
 who eat the flesh of my people,
 Then they will cry to the Lord,
Thus says the Lord concerning the prophets
Therefore it shall be night to you, without vision,
 the seers shall be disgraced,
But as for me, I am filled with power,
 Hear this, you heads of the house of Jacob
 who build Zion with blood
 Its heads give judgment for a bribe;
Therefore because of you
It shall come to pass in the latter days
and many nations shall come, and say:
He shall judge between many peoples,
 but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree,
For all the peoples walk
 In that day, declares the Lord,
and the lame I will make the remnant,
And you, O tower of the flock,
Now why do you cry aloud?
 Writhe and groan, O daughter of Zion,
Now many nations
But they do not know
Arise and thresh,
  Now muster your troops, O daughter of troops;
  But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah,
Therefore he shall give them up until the time
And he shall stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the Lord,
And he shall be their peace.
they shall shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword,
Then the remnant of Jacob shall be
And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations,
Your hand shall be lifted up over your adversaries,
And in that day, declares the Lord,
 and I will cut off the cities of your land
and I will cut off sorceries from your hand,
and I will cut off your carved images
and I will root out your Asherah images from among you
And in anger and wrath I will execute vengeance
 Hear what the Lord says:
 Hear, you mountains, the indictment of the Lord,
“O my people, what have I done to you?
For I brought you up from the land of Egypt
O my people, remember what Balak king of Moab devised,
 “With what shall I come before the Lord,
 Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams,
He has told you, O man, what is good;
The voice of the Lord cries to the city—
Can I forget any longer the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked,
Shall I acquit the man with wicked scales
Your rich men are full of violence;
Therefore I strike you with a grievous blow,
 You shall eat, but not be satisfied,
 You shall sow, but not reap;
For you have kept the statutes of Omri,
Woe is me! For I have become
 The godly has perished from the earth,
 Their hands are on what is evil, to do it well;
The best of them is like a brier,
 Put no trust in a neighbor;
for the son treats the father with contempt,
But as for me, I will look to the Lord;
 Rejoice not over me, O my enemy;
 I will bear the indignation of the Lord
Then my enemy will see,
 A day for the building of your walls!
In that day they will come to you,
But the earth will be desolate
 Shepherd your people with your staff,
 As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt,
 The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might;
 they shall lick the dust like a serpent,
 Who is a God like you, pardoning iniquity
He will again have compassion on us;
 You will show faithfulness to Jacob
