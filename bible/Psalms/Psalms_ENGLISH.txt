Blessed is the man
but his delight is in the law of the Lord,
He is like a tree
The wicked are not so,
Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
for the Lord knows the way of the righteous,
 Why do the nations rage
The kings of the earth set themselves,
“Let us burst their bonds apart
He who sits in the heavens laughs;
Then he will speak to them in his wrath,
“As for me, I have set my King
I will tell of the decree:
Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage,
You shall break them with a rod of iron
Now therefore, O kings, be wise;
 Serve the Lord with fear,
 Kiss the Son,
O Lord, how many are my foes!
many are saying of my soul,
But you, O Lord, are a shield about me,
I cried aloud to the Lord,
I lay down and slept;
I will not be afraid of many thousands of people
 Arise, O Lord!
 Salvation belongs to the Lord;
Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness!
O men, how long shall my honor be turned into shame?
But know that the Lord has set apart the godly for himself;
 Be angry, and do not sin;
Offer right sacrifices,
There are many who say, “Who will show us some good?
You have put more joy in my heart
In peace I will both lie down and sleep;
Give ear to my words, O Lord;
Give attention to the sound of my cry,
O Lord, in the morning you hear my voice;
For you are not a God who delights in wickedness;
The boastful shall not stand before your eyes;
You destroy those who speak lies;
But I, through the abundance of your steadfast love,
 Lead me, O Lord, in your righteousness
For there is no truth in their mouth;
 Make them bear their guilt, O God;
But let all who take refuge in you rejoice;
For you bless the righteous, O Lord;
O Lord, rebuke me not in your anger,
Be gracious to me, O Lord, for I am languishing;
My soul also is greatly troubled.
Turn, O Lord, deliver my life;
For in death there is no remembrance of you;
I am weary with my moaning;
My eye wastes away because of grief;
 Depart from me, all you workers of evil,
The Lord has heard my plea;
All my enemies shall be ashamed and greatly troubled;
O Lord my God, in you do I take refuge;
lest like a lion they tear my soul apart,
O Lord my God, if I have done this,
if I have repaid my friend with evil
let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it,
 Arise, O Lord, in your anger;
Let the assembly of the peoples be gathered about you;
The Lord judges the peoples;
Oh, let the evil of the wicked come to an end,
My shield is with God,
God is a righteous judge,
If a man does not repent, God will whet his sword;
he has prepared for him his deadly weapons,
Behold, the wicked man conceives evil
He makes a pit, digging it out,
His mischief returns upon his own head,
I will give to the Lord the thanks due to his righteousness,
O Lord, our Lord,
 Out of the mouth of babies and infants,
When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers,
 what is man that you are mindful of him,
Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings
You have given him dominion over the works of your hands;
all sheep and oxen,
the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea,
O Lord, our Lord,
I will give thanks to the Lord with my whole heart;
I will be glad and exult in you;
When my enemies turn back,
For you have maintained my just cause;
You have rebuked the nations; you have made the wicked perish;
The enemy came to an end in everlasting ruins;
But the Lord sits enthroned forever;
and he judges the world with righteousness;
The Lord is a stronghold for the oppressed,
And those who know your name put their trust in you,
Sing praises to the Lord, who sits enthroned in Zion!
For he who avenges blood is mindful of them;
 Be gracious to me, O Lord!
that I may recount all your praises,
The nations have sunk in the pit that they made;
The Lord has made himself known; he has executed judgment;
The wicked shall return to Sheol,
For the needy shall not always be forgotten,
 Arise, O Lord! Let not man prevail;
Put them in fear, O Lord!
Why, O Lord, do you stand far away?
In arrogance the wicked hotly pursue the poor;
For the wicked boasts of the desires of his soul,
In the pride of his face the wicked does not seek him;
His ways prosper at all times;
He says in his heart, “I shall not be moved;
 His mouth is filled with cursing and deceit and oppression;
He sits in ambush in the villages;
he lurks in ambush like a lion in his thicket;
The helpless are crushed, sink down,
He says in his heart, “God has forgotten,
 Arise, O Lord; O God, lift up your hand;
Why does the wicked renounce God
But you do see, for you note mischief and vexation,
 Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer;
 The Lord is king forever and ever;
O Lord, you hear the desire of the afflicted;
to do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed,
In the Lord I take refuge;
for behold, the wicked bend the bow;
if the foundations are destroyed,
 The Lord is in his holy temple;
The Lord tests the righteous,
Let him rain coals on the wicked;
For the Lord is righteous;
Save, O Lord, for the godly one is gone;
Everyone utters lies to his neighbor;
May the Lord cut off all flattering lips,
those who say, “With our tongue we will prevail,
“Because the poor are plundered, because the needy groan,
 The words of the Lord are pure words,
You, O Lord, will keep them;
On every side the wicked prowl,
 How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever?
How long must I take counsel in my soul
 Consider and answer me, O Lord my God;
 lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed over him,”
But I have trusted in your steadfast love;
I will sing to the Lord,
 The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.”
The Lord looks down from heaven on the children of man,
They have all turned aside; together they have become corrupt;
Have they no knowledge, all the evildoers
There they are in great terror,
You would shame the plans of the poor,
Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion!
O Lord, who shall sojourn in your tent?
He who walks blamelessly and does what is right
who does not slander with his tongue
 in whose eyes a vile person is despised,
who does not put out his money at interest
Preserve me, O God, for in you I take refuge.
I say to the Lord, “You are my Lord;
As for the saints in the land, they are the excellent ones,
The sorrows of those who run after another god shall multiply;
The Lord is my chosen portion and my cup;
 The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places;
I bless the Lord who gives me counsel;
 I have set the Lord always before me;
Therefore my heart is glad, and my whole being rejoices;
For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol,
You make known to me the path of life;
Hear a just cause, O Lord; attend to my cry!
From your presence let my vindication come!
You have tried my heart, you have visited me by night,
With regard to the works of man, by the word of your lips
My steps have held fast to your paths;
I call upon you, for you will answer me, O God;
 Wondrously show your steadfast love,
Keep me as the apple of your eye;
from the wicked who do me violence,
 They close their hearts to pity;
They have now surrounded our steps;
He is like a lion eager to tear,
Arise, O Lord! Confront him, subdue him!
from men by your hand, O Lord,
As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness;
I love you, O Lord, my strength.
The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer,
I call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised,
 The cords of death encompassed me;
 the cords of Sheol entangled me;
 In my distress I called upon the Lord;
Then the earth reeled and rocked;
Smoke went up from his nostrils,
He bowed the heavens and came down;
He rode on a cherub and flew;
He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him,
Out of the brightness before him
The Lord also thundered in the heavens,
And he sent out his arrows and scattered them;
Then the channels of the sea were seen,
He sent from on high, he took me;
He rescued me from my strong enemy
They confronted me in the day of my calamity,
He brought me out into a broad place;
The Lord dealt with me according to my righteousness;
For I have kept the ways of the Lord,
For all his rules were before me,
I was blameless before him,
So the Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness,
With the merciful you show yourself merciful;
with the purified you show yourself pure;
For you save a humble people,
For it is you who light my lamp;
For by you I can run against a troop,
This God—his way is perfect;
For who is God, but the Lord?
the God who equipped me with strength
He made my feet like the feet of a deer
He trains my hands for war,
You have given me the shield of your salvation,
You gave a wide place for my steps under me,
I pursued my enemies and overtook them,
I thrust them through, so that they were not able to rise;
For you equipped me with strength for the battle;
You made my enemies turn their backs to me,
 They cried for help, but there was none to save;
I beat them fine as dust before the wind;
You delivered me from strife with the people;
As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me;
 Foreigners lost heart
The Lord lives, and blessed be my rock,
the God who gave me vengeance
who rescued me from my enemies;
 For this I will praise you, O Lord, among the nations,
Great salvation he brings to his king,
 The heavens declare the glory of God,
Day to day pours out speech,
There is no speech, nor are there words,
 Their voice goes out through all the earth,
 which comes out like a bridegroom leaving his chamber,
Its rising is from the end of the heavens,
 The law of the Lord is perfect,
 the precepts of the Lord are right,
the fear of the Lord is clean,
More to be desired are they than gold,
Moreover, by them is your servant warned;
 Who can discern his errors?
 Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins;
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart
May the Lord answer you in the day of trouble!
May he send you help from the sanctuary
May he remember all your offerings
May he grant you your heart’s desire
May we shout for joy over your salvation,
Now I know that the Lord saves his anointed;
Some trust in chariots and some in horses,
They collapse and fall,
O Lord, save the king!
O Lord, in your strength the king rejoices,
You have given him his heart’s desire
For you meet him with rich blessings;
He asked life of you; you gave it to him,
His glory is great through your salvation;
For you make him most blessed forever;
For the king trusts in the Lord,
Your hand will find out all your enemies;
You will make them as a blazing oven
You will destroy their descendants from the earth,
Though they plan evil against you,
For you will put them to flight;
Be exalted, O Lord, in your strength!
 My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
O my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer,
Yet you are holy,
In you our fathers trusted;
To you they cried and were rescued;
But I am a worm and not a man,
All who see me mock me;
 “He trusts in the Lord; let him deliver him;
Yet you are he who took me from the womb;
On you was I cast from my birth,
Be not far from me,
Many bulls encompass me;
they open wide their mouths at me,
I am poured out like water,
my strength is dried up like a potsherd,
For dogs encompass me;
I can count all my bones—
 they divide my garments among them,
But you, O Lord, do not be far off!
Deliver my soul from the sword,
Save me from the mouth of the lion!
 I will tell of your name to my brothers;
You who fear the Lord, praise him!
For he has not despised or abhorred
From you comes my praise in the great congregation;
 The afflicted shall eat and be satisfied;
All the ends of the earth shall remember
For kingship belongs to the Lord,
All the prosperous of the earth eat and worship;
Posterity shall serve him;
they shall come and proclaim his righteousness to a people yet unborn,
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
He makes me lie down in green pastures.
He restores my soul.
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
You prepare a table before me
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
 The earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof,
for he has founded it upon the seas
 Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord?
 He who has clean hands and a pure heart,
He will receive blessing from the Lord
Such is the generation of those who seek him,
 Lift up your heads, O gates!
Who is this King of glory?
Lift up your heads, O gates!
Who is this King of glory?
To you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
O my God, in you I trust;
Indeed, none who wait for you shall be put to shame;
 Make me to know your ways, O Lord;
Lead me in your truth and teach me,
Remember your mercy, O Lord, and your steadfast love,
Remember not the sins of my youth or my transgressions;
 Good and upright is the Lord;
He leads the humble in what is right,
All the paths of the Lord are steadfast love and faithfulness,
For your name’s sake, O Lord,
Who is the man who fears the Lord?
His soul shall abide in well-being,
 The friendship of the Lord is for those who fear him,
My eyes are ever toward the Lord,
 Turn to me and be gracious to me,
The troubles of my heart are enlarged;
 Consider my affliction and my trouble,
Consider how many are my foes,
Oh, guard my soul, and deliver me!
May integrity and uprightness preserve me,
 Redeem Israel, O God,
To you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
O my God, in you I trust;
Indeed, none who wait for you shall be put to shame;
 Make me to know your ways, O Lord;
Lead me in your truth and teach me,
Remember your mercy, O Lord, and your steadfast love,
Remember not the sins of my youth or my transgressions;
 Good and upright is the Lord;
He leads the humble in what is right,
All the paths of the Lord are steadfast love and faithfulness,
For your name’s sake, O Lord,
Who is the man who fears the Lord?
His soul shall abide in well-being,
 The friendship of the Lord is for those who fear him,
My eyes are ever toward the Lord,
 Turn to me and be gracious to me,
The troubles of my heart are enlarged;
 Consider my affliction and my trouble,
Consider how many are my foes,
Oh, guard my soul, and deliver me!
May integrity and uprightness preserve me,
 Redeem Israel, O God,
 Vindicate me, O Lord,
 Prove me, O Lord, and try me;
For your steadfast love is before my eyes,
I do not sit with men of falsehood,
I hate the assembly of evildoers,
I wash my hands in innocence
proclaiming thanksgiving aloud,
O Lord, I love the habitation of your house
 Do not sweep my soul away with sinners,
in whose hands are evil devices,
But as for me, I shall walk in my integrity;
My foot stands on level ground;
The Lord is my light and my salvation;
When evildoers assail me
 Though an army encamp against me,
 One thing have I asked of the Lord,
For he will hide me in his shelter
And now my head shall be lifted up
 Hear, O Lord, when I cry aloud;
You have said, “Seek my face.”
 Hide not your face from me.
For my father and my mother have forsaken me,
 Teach me your way, O Lord,
 Give me not up to the will of my adversaries;
I believe that I shall look upon the goodness of the Lord
 Wait for the Lord;
To you, O Lord, I call;
 Hear the voice of my pleas for mercy,
Do not drag me off with the wicked,
 Give to them according to their work
Because they do not regard the works of the Lord
Blessed be the Lord!
The Lord is my strength and my shield;
The Lord is the strength of his people;
Oh, save your people and bless your heritage!
Ascribe to the Lord, O heavenly beings,
Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name;
The voice of the Lord is over the waters;
The voice of the Lord is powerful;
The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars;
He makes Lebanon to skip like a calf,
The voice of the Lord flashes forth flames of fire.
The voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness;
The voice of the Lord makes the deer give birth
The Lord sits enthroned over the flood;
May the Lord give strength to his people!
I will extol you, O Lord, for you have drawn me up
O Lord my God, I cried to you for help,
O Lord, you have brought up my soul from Sheol;
Sing praises to the Lord, O you his saints,
 For his anger is but for a moment,
As for me, I said in my prosperity,
By your favor, O Lord,
To you, O Lord, I cry,
“What profit is there in my death,
 Hear, O Lord, and be merciful to me!
You have turned for me my mourning into dancing;
that my glory may sing your praise and not be silent.
 In you, O Lord, do I take refuge;
Incline your ear to me;
For you are my rock and my fortress;
you take me out of the net they have hidden for me,
 Into your hand I commit my spirit;
I hate those who pay regard to worthless idols,
I will rejoice and be glad in your steadfast love,
and you have not delivered me into the hand of the enemy;
Be gracious to me, O Lord, for I am in distress;
For my life is spent with sorrow,
Because of all my adversaries I have become a reproach,
I have been forgotten like one who is dead;
For I hear the whispering of many—
But I trust in you, O Lord;
My times are in your hand;
 Make your face shine on your servant;
O Lord, let me not be put to shame,
Let the lying lips be mute,
Oh, how abundant is your goodness,
In the cover of your presence you hide them
Blessed be the Lord,
I had said in my alarm,
Love the Lord, all you his saints!
 Be strong, and let your heart take courage,
 Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven,
Blessed is the man against whom the Lord counts no iniquity,
For when I kept silent, my bones wasted away
For day and night your hand was heavy upon me;
I acknowledged my sin to you,
Therefore let everyone who is godly
You are a hiding place for me;
I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go;
 Be not like a horse or a mule, without understanding,
 Many are the sorrows of the wicked,
 Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, O righteous,
 Shout for joy in the Lord, O you righteous!
Give thanks to the Lord with the lyre;
Sing to him a new song;
For the word of the Lord is upright,
He loves righteousness and justice;
By the word of the Lord the heavens were made,
He gathers the waters of the sea as a heap;
Let all the earth fear the Lord;
For he spoke, and it came to be;
The Lord brings the counsel of the nations to nothing;
 The counsel of the Lord stands forever,
 Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord,
The Lord looks down from heaven;
from where he sits enthroned he looks out
he who fashions the hearts of them all
 The king is not saved by his great army;
 The war horse is a false hope for salvation,
Behold, the eye of the Lord is on those who fear him,
that he may deliver their soul from death
Our soul waits for the Lord;
For our heart is glad in him,
Let your steadfast love, O Lord, be upon us,
I will bless the Lord at all times;
My soul makes its boast in the Lord;
Oh, magnify the Lord with me,
I sought the Lord, and he answered me
Those who look to him are radiant,
 This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him
 The angel of the Lord encamps
Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good!
Oh, fear the Lord, you his saints,
 The young lions suffer want and hunger;
 Come, O children, listen to me;
 What man is there who desires life
 Keep your tongue from evil
 Turn away from evil and do good;
 The eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous
 The face of the Lord is against those who do evil,
 When the righteous cry for help, the Lord hears
The Lord is near to the brokenhearted
 Many are the afflictions of the righteous,
He keeps all his bones;
 Affliction will slay the wicked,
The Lord redeems the life of his servants;
Contend, O Lord, with those who contend with me;
Take hold of shield and buckler
Draw the spear and javelin
 Let them be put to shame and dishonor
Let them be like chaff before the wind,
Let their way be dark and slippery,
For without cause they hid their net for me;
Let destruction come upon him when he does not know it!
Then my soul will rejoice in the Lord,
All my bones shall say,
 Malicious witnesses rise up;
 They repay me evil for good;
But I, when they were sick—
I went about as though I grieved for my friend or my brother;
But at my stumbling they rejoiced and gathered;
like profane mockers at a feast,
How long, O Lord, will you look on?
I will thank you in the great congregation;
 Let not those rejoice over me
For they do not speak peace,
They open wide their mouths against me;
 You have seen, O Lord; be not silent!
Awake and rouse yourself for my vindication,
 Vindicate me, O Lord, my God,
Let them not say in their hearts,
Let them be put to shame and disappointed altogether
Let those who delight in my righteousness
Then my tongue shall tell of your righteousness
Transgression speaks to the wicked
 For he flatters himself in his own eyes
The words of his mouth are trouble and deceit;
He plots trouble while on his bed;
Your steadfast love, O Lord, extends to the heavens,
 Your righteousness is like the mountains of God;
 How precious is your steadfast love, O God!
They feast on the abundance of your house,
For with you is the fountain of life;
Oh, continue your steadfast love to those who know you,
Let not the foot of arrogance come upon me,
There the evildoers lie fallen;
 Fret not yourself because of evildoers;
For they will soon fade like the grass
 Trust in the Lord, and do good;
 Delight yourself in the Lord,
 Commit your way to the Lord;
 He will bring forth your righteousness as the light,
 Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him;
 Refrain from anger, and forsake wrath!
 For the evildoers shall be cut off,
In just a little while, the wicked will be no more;
But the meek shall inherit the land
The wicked plots against the righteous
but the Lord laughs at the wicked,
The wicked draw the sword and bend their bows
their sword shall enter their own heart,
 Better is the little that the righteous has
For the arms of the wicked shall be broken,
The Lord knows the days of the blameless,
they are not put to shame in evil times;
But the wicked will perish;
The wicked borrows but does not pay back,
for those blessed by the Lord shall inherit the land,
The steps of a man are established by the Lord,
 though he fall, he shall not be cast headlong,
I have been young, and now am old,
He is ever lending generously,
 Turn away from evil and do good;
For the Lord loves justice;
The righteous shall inherit the land
The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom,
 The law of his God is in his heart;
The wicked watches for the righteous
The Lord will not abandon him to his power
 Wait for the Lord and keep his way,
 I have seen a wicked, ruthless man,
But he passed away, and behold, he was no more;
Mark the blameless and behold the upright,
But transgressors shall be altogether destroyed;
 The salvation of the righteous is from the Lord;
The Lord helps them and delivers them;
O Lord, rebuke me not in your anger,
For your arrows have sunk into me,
There is no soundness in my flesh
For my iniquities have gone over my head;
My wounds stink and fester
I am utterly bowed down and prostrate;
For my sides are filled with burning,
I am feeble and crushed;
O Lord, all my longing is before you;
My heart throbs; my strength fails me,
My friends and companions stand aloof from my plague,
Those who seek my life lay their snares;
But I am like a deaf man; I do not hear,
I have become like a man who does not hear,
But for you, O Lord, do I wait;
For I said, “Only let them not rejoice over me,
For I am ready to fall,
I confess my iniquity;
But my foes are vigorous, they are mighty,
Those who render me evil for good
Do not forsake me, O Lord!
 Make haste to help me,
I said, “I will guard my ways,
I was mute and silent;
My heart became hot within me.
“O Lord, make me know my end
Behold, you have made my days a few handbreadths,
Surely a man goes about as a shadow!
“And now, O Lord, for what do I wait?
Deliver me from all my transgressions.
 I am mute; I do not open my mouth,
 Remove your stroke from me;
When you discipline a man
 “Hear my prayer, O Lord,
 Look away from me, that I may smile again,
I waited patiently for the Lord;
He drew me up from the pit of destruction,
He put a new song in my mouth,
Blessed is the man who makes
You have multiplied, O Lord my God,
 In sacrifice and offering you have not delighted,
Then I said, “Behold, I have come;
 I delight to do your will, O my God;
I have told the glad news of deliverance
I have not hidden your deliverance within my heart;
As for you, O Lord, you will not restrain
For evils have encompassed me
 Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me!
 Let those be put to shame and disappointed altogether
Let those be appalled because of their shame
But may all who seek you
As for me, I am poor and needy,
 Blessed is the one who considers the poor!
the Lord protects him and keeps him alive;
The Lord sustains him on his sickbed;
As for me, I said, “O Lord, be gracious to me;
My enemies say of me in malice,
And when one comes to see me, he utters empty words,
All who hate me whisper together about me;
They say, “A deadly thing is poured out on him;
Even my close friend in whom I trusted,
But you, O Lord, be gracious to me,
By this I know that you delight in me:
But you have upheld me because of my integrity,
 Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,
 As a deer pants for flowing streams,
 My soul thirsts for God,
 My tears have been my food
These things I remember,
 Why are you cast down, O my soul,
and my God.
Deep calls to deep
By day the Lord commands his steadfast love,
I say to God, my rock:
As with a deadly wound in my bones,
 Why are you cast down, O my soul,
 Vindicate me, O God, and defend my cause
For you are the God in whom I take refuge;
 Send out your light and your truth;
Then I will go to the altar of God,
 Why are you cast down, O my soul,
O God, we have heard with our ears,
you with your own hand drove out the nations,
for not by their own sword did they win the land,
 You are my King, O God;
Through you we push down our foes;
For not in my bow do I trust,
But you have saved us from our foes
 In God we have boasted continually,
But you have rejected us and disgraced us
You have made us turn back from the foe,
You have made us like sheep for slaughter
 You have sold your people for a trifle,
You have made us the taunt of our neighbors,
You have made us a byword among the nations,
All day long my disgrace is before me,
at the sound of the taunter and reviler,
 All this has come upon us,
Our heart has not turned back,
yet you have broken us in the place of jackals
If we had forgotten the name of our God
 would not God discover this?
Yet for your sake we are killed all the day long;
 Awake! Why are you sleeping, O Lord?
Why do you hide your face?
For our soul is bowed down to the dust;
Rise up; come to our help!
My heart overflows with a pleasing theme;
You are the most handsome of the sons of men;
 Gird your sword on your thigh, O mighty one,
In your majesty ride out victoriously
Your arrows are sharp
 Your throne, O God, is forever and ever.
 you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness.
your robes are all fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia.
daughters of kings are among your ladies of honor;
Hear, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear:
and the king will desire your beauty.
The people of Tyre will seek your favor with gifts,
All glorious is the princess in her chamber, with robes interwoven with gold.
 In many-colored robes she is led to the king,
With joy and gladness they are led along
In place of your fathers shall be your sons;
 I will cause your name to be remembered in all generations;
God is our refuge and strength,
Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way,
though its waters roar and foam,
There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,
 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved;
 The nations rage, the kingdoms totter;
 The Lord of hosts is with us;
 Come, behold the works of the Lord,
 He makes wars cease to the end of the earth;
 “Be still, and know that I am God.
 The Lord of hosts is with us;
 Clap your hands, all peoples!
For the Lord, the Most High, is to be feared,
He subdued peoples under us,
He chose our heritage for us,
God has gone up with a shout,
Sing praises to God, sing praises!
For God is the King of all the earth;
God reigns over the nations;
 The princes of the peoples gather
 Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised
beautiful in elevation,
Within her citadels God
For behold, the kings assembled;
As soon as they saw it, they were astounded;
 Trembling took hold of them there,
By the east wind you shattered
As we have heard, so have we seen
We have thought on your steadfast love, O God,
As your name, O God,
Let Mount Zion be glad!
Walk about Zion, go around her,
consider well her ramparts,
that this is God,
 Hear this, all peoples!
 both low and high,
My mouth shall speak wisdom;
I will incline my ear to a proverb;
 Why should I fear in times of trouble,
those who trust in their wealth
Truly no man can ransom another,
for the ransom of their life is costly
that he should live on forever
For he sees that even the wise die;
Their graves are their homes forever,
Man in his pomp will not remain;
This is the path of those who have foolish confidence;
Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol;
But God will ransom my soul from the power of Sheol,
Be not afraid when a man becomes rich,
 For when he dies he will carry nothing away;
For though, while he lives, he counts himself blessed
his soul will go to the generation of his fathers,
 Man in his pomp yet without understanding is like the beasts that perish.
 The Mighty One, God the Lord,
Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,
Our God comes; he does not keep silence;
 He calls to the heavens above
“Gather to me my faithful ones,
 The heavens declare his righteousness,
 “Hear, O my people, and I will speak;
Not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you;
I will not accept a bull from your house
For every beast of the forest is mine,
 I know all the birds of the hills,
“If I were hungry, I would not tell you,
Do I eat the flesh of bulls
 Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving,
and call upon me in the day of trouble;
But to the wicked God says:
 For you hate discipline,
If you see a thief, you are pleased with him,
“You give your mouth free rein for evil,
You sit and speak against your brother;
These things you have done, and I have been silent;
“Mark this, then, you who forget God,
The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me;
 Have mercy on me, O God,
 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity,
 For I know my transgressions,
 Against you, you only, have I sinned
Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,
Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being,
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean;
Let me hear joy and gladness;
 Hide your face from my sins,
 Create in me a clean heart, O God,
 Cast me not away from your presence,
Restore to me the joy of your salvation,
Then I will teach transgressors your ways,
Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God,
O Lord, open my lips,
 For you will not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it;
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit;
 Do good to Zion in your good pleasure;
then will you delight in right sacrifices,
Why do you boast of evil, O mighty man?
Your tongue plots destruction,
You love evil more than good,
You love all words that devour,
But God will break you down forever;
The righteous shall see and fear,
“See the man who would not make
But I am like a green olive tree
I will thank you forever,
 The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.”
God looks down from heaven
They have all fallen away;
Have those who work evil no knowledge,
There they are, in great terror,
Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion!
O God, save me by your name,
O God, hear my prayer;
 For strangers have risen against me;
Behold, God is my helper;
He will return the evil to my enemies;
With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you;
For he has delivered me from every trouble,
 Give ear to my prayer, O God,
Attend to me, and answer me;
because of the noise of the enemy,
My heart is in anguish within me;
Fear and trembling come upon me,
And I say, “Oh, that I had wings like a dove!
 yes, I would wander far away;
I would hurry to find a shelter
Destroy, O Lord, divide their tongues;
Day and night they go around it
ruin is in its midst;
For it is not an enemy who taunts me—
 But it is you, a man, my equal,
We used to take sweet counsel together;
Let death steal over them;
But I call to God,
 Evening and morning and at noon
He redeems my soul in safety
God will give ear and humble them,
My companion stretched out his hand against his friends;
His speech was smooth as butter,
 Cast your burden on the Lord,
But you, O God, will cast them down
 Be gracious to me, O God, for man tramples on me;
my enemies trample on me all day long,
When I am afraid,
In God, whose word I praise,
All day long they injure my cause;
They stir up strife, they lurk;
For their crime will they escape?
You have kept count of my tossings;
Then my enemies will turn back
In God, whose word I praise,
in God I trust; I shall not be afraid.
I must perform my vows to you, O God;
 For you have delivered my soul from death,
 Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me,
I cry out to God Most High,
 He will send from heaven and save me;
My soul is in the midst of lions;
 Be exalted, O God, above the heavens!
They set a net for my steps;
 My heart is steadfast, O God,
 Awake, my glory!
I will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples;
For your steadfast love is great to the heavens,
 Be exalted, O God, above the heavens!
Do you indeed decree what is right, you gods?
No, in your hearts you devise wrongs;
The wicked are estranged from the womb;
 They have venom like the venom of a serpent,
so that it does not hear the voice of charmers
O God, break the teeth in their mouths;
Let them vanish like water that runs away;
Let them be like the snail that dissolves into slime,
Sooner than your pots can feel the heat of thorns,
 The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance;
Mankind will say, “Surely there is a reward for the righteous;
 Deliver me from my enemies, O my God;
deliver me from those who work evil,
For behold, they lie in wait for my life;
for no fault of mine, they run and make ready.
You, Lord God of hosts, are God of Israel.
Each evening they come back,
There they are, bellowing with their mouths
But you, O Lord, laugh at them;
O my Strength, I will watch for you,
 My God in his steadfast love will meet me;
Kill them not, lest my people forget;
For the sin of their mouths, the words of their lips,
 consume them in wrath;
 Each evening they come back,
They wander about for food
But I will sing of your strength;
O my Strength, I will sing praises to you,
O God, you have rejected us, broken our defenses;
You have made the land to quake; you have torn it open;
 You have made your people see hard things;
You have set up a banner for those who fear you,
 That your beloved ones may be delivered,
God has spoken in his holiness:
 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine;
 Moab is my washbasin;
Who will bring me to the fortified city?
Have you not rejected us, O God?
Oh, grant us help against the foe,
With God we shall do valiantly;
Hear my cry, O God,
from the end of the earth I call to you
for you have been my refuge,
Let me dwell in your tent forever!
For you, O God, have heard my vows;
 Prolong the life of the king;
May he be enthroned forever before God;
So will I ever sing praises to your name,
For God alone my soul waits in silence;
 He alone is my rock and my salvation,
How long will all of you attack a man
They only plan to thrust him down from his high position.
For God alone, O my soul, wait in silence,
 He only is my rock and my salvation,
On God rests my salvation and my glory;
 Trust in him at all times, O people;
 Those of low estate are but a breath;
Put no trust in extortion;
 Once God has spoken;
and that to you, O Lord, belongs steadfast love.
O God, you are my God; earnestly I seek you;
So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary,
Because your steadfast love is better than life,
So I will bless you as long as I live;
My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food,
when I remember you upon my bed,
for you have been my help,
My soul clings to you;
But those who seek to destroy my life
they shall be given over to the power of the sword;
But the king shall rejoice in God;
Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint;
Hide me from the secret plots of the wicked,
who whet their tongues like swords,
shooting from ambush at the blameless,
They hold fast to their evil purpose;
They search out injustice,
 But God shoots his arrow at them;
They are brought to ruin, with their own tongues turned against them;
Then all mankind fears;
Let the righteous one rejoice in the Lord
Praise is due to you, O God, in Zion,
O you who hear prayer,
When iniquities prevail against me,
 Blessed is the one you choose and bring near,
By awesome deeds you answer us with righteousness,
the one who by his strength established the mountains,
who stills the roaring of the seas,
so that those who dwell at the ends of the earth are in awe at your signs.
You visit the earth and water it;
You water its furrows abundantly,
You crown the year with your bounty;
 The pastures of the wilderness overflow,
 the meadows clothe themselves with flocks,
 Shout for joy to God, all the earth;
sing the glory of his name;
Say to God, “How awesome are your deeds!
 All the earth worships you
 Come and see what God has done:
He turned the sea into dry land;
who rules by his might forever,
Bless our God, O peoples;
who has kept our soul among the living
For you, O God, have tested us;
You brought us into the net;
you let men ride over our heads;
I will come into your house with burnt offerings;
that which my lips uttered
I will offer to you burnt offerings of fattened animals,
 Come and hear, all you who fear God,
I cried to him with my mouth,
If I had cherished iniquity in my heart,
But truly God has listened;
Blessed be God,
May God be gracious to us and bless us
that your way may be known on earth,
 Let the peoples praise you, O God;
Let the nations be glad and sing for joy,
 Let the peoples praise you, O God;
The earth has yielded its increase;
God shall bless us;
 God shall arise, his enemies shall be scattered;
As smoke is driven away, so you shall drive them away;
But the righteous shall be glad;
Sing to God, sing praises to his name;
 Father of the fatherless and protector of widows
God settles the solitary in a home;
O God, when you went out before your people,
 the earth quaked, the heavens poured down rain,
 Rain in abundance, O God, you shed abroad;
your flock found a dwelling in it;
The Lord gives the word;
 “The kings of the armies—they flee, they flee!”
though you men lie among the sheepfolds—
When the Almighty scatters kings there,
O mountain of God, mountain of Bashan;
Why do you look with hatred, O many-peaked mountain,
 The chariots of God are twice ten thousand,
 You ascended on high,
Blessed be the Lord,
Our God is a God of salvation,
 But God will strike the heads of his enemies,
The Lord said,
that you may strike your feet in their blood,
Your procession is seen, O God,
 the singers in front, the musicians last,
 “Bless God in the great congregation,
There is Benjamin, the least of them, in the lead,
 Summon your power, O God,
Because of your temple at Jerusalem
Rebuke the beasts that dwell among the reeds,
Nobles shall come from Egypt;
 O kingdoms of the earth, sing to God;
to him who rides in the heavens, the ancient heavens;
 Ascribe power to God,
 Awesome is God from his sanctuary;
Save me, O God!
I sink in deep mire,
 I am weary with my crying out;
 More in number than the hairs of my head
O God, you know my folly;
Let not those who hope in you be put to shame through me,
For it is for your sake that I have borne reproach,
I have become a stranger to my brothers,
For zeal for your house has consumed me,
When I wept and humbled my soul with fasting,
When I made sackcloth my clothing,
I am the talk of those who sit in the gate,
But as for me, my prayer is to you, O Lord.
Deliver me
Let not the flood sweep over me,
Answer me, O Lord, for your steadfast love is good;
 Hide not your face from your servant,
Draw near to my soul, redeem me;
You know my reproach,
 Reproaches have broken my heart,
They gave me poison for food,
 Let their own table before them become a snare;
 Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see,
Pour out your indignation upon them,
 May their camp be a desolation;
For they persecute him whom you have struck down,
 Add to them punishment upon punishment;
Let them be blotted out of the book of the living;
But I am afflicted and in pain;
I will praise the name of God with a song;
This will please the Lord more than an ox
When the humble see it they will be glad;
For the Lord hears the needy
Let heaven and earth praise him,
For God will save Zion
 the offspring of his servants shall inherit it,
 Make haste, O God, to deliver me!
Let them be put to shame and confusion
Let them turn back because of their shame
May all who seek you
But I am poor and needy;
 In you, O Lord, do I take refuge;
In your righteousness deliver me and rescue me;
Be to me a rock of refuge,
 Rescue me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked,
For you, O Lord, are my hope,
Upon you I have leaned from before my birth;
I have been as a portent to many,
My mouth is filled with your praise,
 Do not cast me off in the time of old age;
For my enemies speak concerning me;
and say, “God has forsaken him;
O God, be not far from me;
May my accusers be put to shame and consumed;
But I will hope continually
My mouth will tell of your righteous acts,
With the mighty deeds of the Lord God I will come;
O God, from my youth you have taught me,
So even to old age and gray hairs,
Your righteousness, O God,
You who have made me see many troubles and calamities
You will increase my greatness
I will also praise you with the harp
My lips will shout for joy,
And my tongue will talk of your righteous help all the day long,
Give the king your justice, O God,
May he judge your people with righteousness,
Let the mountains bear prosperity for the people,
May he defend the cause of the poor of the people,
May they fear you while the sun endures,
May he be like rain that falls on the mown grass,
In his days may the righteous flourish,
May he have dominion from sea to sea,
May desert tribes bow down before him,
May the kings of Tarshish and of the coastlands
May all kings fall down before him,
For he delivers the needy when he calls,
He has pity on the weak and the needy,
From oppression and violence he redeems their life,
Long may he live;
May there be abundance of grain in the land;
 May his name endure forever,
 Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,
Blessed be his glorious name forever;
 The prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are ended.
Truly God is good to Israel,
But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled,
 For I was envious of the arrogant
For they have no pangs until death;
They are not in trouble as others are;
Therefore pride is their necklace;
Their eyes swell out through fatness;
They scoff and speak with malice;
They set their mouths against the heavens,
Therefore his people turn back to them,
And they say, “How can God know?
Behold, these are the wicked;
All in vain have I kept my heart clean
For all the day long I have been stricken
If I had said, “I will speak thus,”
But when I thought how to understand this,
until I went into the sanctuary of God;
Truly you set them in slippery places;
How they are destroyed in a moment,
Like a dream when one awakes,
When my soul was embittered,
I was brutish and ignorant;
Nevertheless, I am continually with you;
You guide me with your counsel,
 Whom have I in heaven but you?
 My flesh and my heart may fail,
For behold, those who are far from you shall perish;
But for me it is good to be near God;
O God, why do you cast us off forever?
 Remember your congregation, which you have purchased of old,
Direct your steps to the perpetual ruins;
Your foes have roared in the midst of your meeting place;
They were like those who swing axes
And all its carved wood
They set your sanctuary on fire;
They said to themselves, “We will utterly subdue them”;
We do not see our signs;
How long, O God, is the foe to scoff?
Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand?
Yet God my King is from of old,
You divided the sea by your might;
You crushed the heads of Leviathan;
You split open springs and brooks;
Yours is the day, yours also the night;
You have fixed all the boundaries of the earth;
 Remember this, O Lord, how the enemy scoffs,
Do not deliver the soul of your dove to the wild beasts;
Have regard for the covenant,
Let not the downtrodden turn back in shame;
Arise, O God, defend your cause;
Do not forget the clamor of your foes,
We give thanks to you, O God;
“At the set time that I appoint
When the earth totters, and all its inhabitants,
I say to the boastful, ‘Do not boast,’
do not lift up your horn on high,
For not from the east or from the west
but it is God who executes judgment,
 For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup
But I will declare it forever;
 All the horns of the wicked I will cut off,
In Judah God is known;
His abode has been established in Salem,
There he broke the flashing arrows,
Glorious are you, more majestic
 The stouthearted were stripped of their spoil;
At your rebuke, O God of Jacob,
 But you, you are to be feared!
From the heavens you uttered judgment;
when God arose to establish judgment,
Surely the wrath of man shall praise you;
 Make your vows to the Lord your God and perform them;
who cuts off the spirit of princes,
I cry aloud to God,
 In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord;
When I remember God, I moan;
You hold my eyelids open;
I consider the days of old,
I said, “Let me remember my song in the night;
“Will the Lord spurn forever,
Has his steadfast love forever ceased?
 Has God forgotten to be gracious?
Then I said, “I will appeal to this,
I will remember the deeds of the Lord;
I will ponder all your work,
Your way, O God, is holy.
You are the God who works wonders;
You with your arm redeemed your people,
When the waters saw you, O God,
The clouds poured out water;
 The crash of your thunder was in the whirlwind;
Your way was through the sea,
You led your people like a flock
 Give ear, O my people, to my teaching;
 I will open my mouth in a parable;
things that we have heard and known,
We will not hide them from their children,
He established a testimony in Jacob
that the next generation might know them,
so that they should set their hope in God
and that they should not be like their fathers,
The Ephraimites, armed with the bow,
They did not keep God’s covenant,
They forgot his works
In the sight of their fathers he performed wonders
He divided the sea and let them pass through it,
 In the daytime he led them with a cloud,
He split rocks in the wilderness
He made streams come out of the rock
Yet they sinned still more against him,
They tested God in their heart
They spoke against God, saying,
 He struck the rock so that water gushed out
Therefore, when the Lord heard, he was full of wrath;
because they did not believe in God
Yet he commanded the skies above
and he rained down on them manna to eat
Man ate of the bread of the angels;
He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens,
he rained meat on them like dust,
he let them fall in the midst of their camp,
And they ate and were well filled,
But before they had satisfied their craving,
the anger of God rose against them,
In spite of all this, they still sinned;
So he made their days vanish like a breath,
When he killed them, they sought him;
They remembered that God was their rock,
But they flattered him with their mouths;
Their heart was not steadfast toward him;
Yet he, being compassionate,
He remembered that they were but flesh,
How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness
They tested God again and again
They did not remember his power
 when he performed his signs in Egypt
He turned their rivers to blood,
He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them,
He gave their crops to the destroying locust
He destroyed their vines with hail
He gave over their cattle to the hail
He let loose on them his burning anger,
He made a path for his anger;
He struck down every firstborn in Egypt,
Then he led out his people like sheep
 He led them in safety, so that they were not afraid,
And he brought them to his holy land,
He drove out nations before them;
Yet they tested and rebelled against the Most High God
but turned away and acted treacherously like their fathers;
For they provoked him to anger with their high places;
When God heard, he was full of wrath,
He forsook his dwelling at Shiloh,
and delivered his power to captivity,
He gave his people over to the sword
 Fire devoured their young men,
Their priests fell by the sword,
Then the Lord awoke as from sleep,
And he put his adversaries to rout;
He rejected the tent of Joseph;
but he chose the tribe of Judah,
He built his sanctuary like the high heavens,
He chose David his servant
from following the nursing ewes he brought him
With upright heart he shepherded them
O God, the nations have come into your inheritance;
They have given the bodies of your servants
They have poured out their blood like water
We have become a taunt to our neighbors,
 How long, O Lord? Will you be angry forever?
 Pour out your anger on the nations
For they have devoured Jacob
 Do not remember against us our former iniquities;
 Help us, O God of our salvation,
 Why should the nations say,
Let the groans of the prisoners come before you;
Return sevenfold into the lap of our neighbors
But we your people, the sheep of your pasture,
Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,
Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh,
 Restore us, O God;
O Lord God of hosts,
You have fed them with the bread of tears
 You make us an object of contention for our neighbors,
 Restore us, O God of hosts;
You brought a vine out of Egypt;
You cleared the ground for it;
The mountains were covered with its shade,
It sent out its branches to the sea
Why then have you broken down its walls,
 The boar from the forest ravages it,
Turn again, O God of hosts!
the stock that your right hand planted,
They have burned it with fire; they have cut it down;
But let your hand be on the man of your right hand,
Then we shall not turn back from you;
 Restore us, O Lord God of hosts!
 Sing aloud to God our strength;
Raise a song; sound the tambourine,
Blow the trumpet at the new moon,
For it is a statute for Israel,
He made it a decree in Joseph
“I relieved your shoulder of the burden;
In distress you called, and I delivered you;
 Hear, O my people, while I admonish you!
There shall be no strange god among you;
 I am the Lord your God,
“But my people did not listen to my voice;
So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts,
 Oh, that my people would listen to me,
I would soon subdue their enemies
Those who hate the Lord would cringe toward him,
But he would feed you with the finest of the wheat,
 God has taken his place in the divine council;
“How long will you judge unjustly
 Give justice to the weak and the fatherless;
 Rescue the weak and the needy;
 They have neither knowledge nor understanding,
 I said, “You are gods,
nevertheless, like men you shall die,
 Arise, O God, judge the earth;
O God, do not keep silence;
For behold, your enemies make an uproar;
They lay crafty plans against your people;
They say, “Come, let us wipe them out as a nation;
For they conspire with one accord;
the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
 Gebal and Ammon and Amalek,
 Asshur also has joined them;
Do to them as you did to Midian,
who were destroyed at En-dor,
Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
who said, “Let us take possession for ourselves
O my God, make them like whirling dust,
As fire consumes the forest,
so may you pursue them with your tempest
 Fill their faces with shame,
Let them be put to shame and dismayed forever;
that they may know that you alone,
How lovely is your dwelling place,
My soul longs, yes, faints
Even the sparrow finds a home,
 Blessed are those who dwell in your house,
Blessed are those whose strength is in you,
As they go through the Valley of Baca
They go from strength to strength;
O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer;
 Behold our shield, O God;
For a day in your courts is better
For the Lord God is a sun and shield;
O Lord of hosts,
 Lord, you were favorable to your land;
You forgave the iniquity of your people;
You withdrew all your wrath;
 Restore us again, O God of our salvation,
 Will you be angry with us forever?
Will you not revive us again,
Show us your steadfast love, O Lord,
 Let me hear what God the Lord will speak,
Surely his salvation is near to those who fear him,
 Steadfast love and faithfulness meet;
Faithfulness springs up from the ground,
Yes, the Lord will give what is good,
 Righteousness will go before him
 Incline your ear, O Lord, and answer me,
Preserve my life, for I am godly;
 Be gracious to me, O Lord,
Gladden the soul of your servant,
For you, O Lord, are good and forgiving,
 Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer;
In the day of my trouble I call upon you,
There is none like you among the gods, O Lord,
 All the nations you have made shall come
For you are great and do wondrous things;
 Teach me your way, O Lord,
I give thanks to you, O Lord my God, with my whole heart,
 For great is your steadfast love toward me;
O God, insolent men have risen up against me;
But you, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious,
 Turn to me and be gracious to me;
 Show me a sign of your favor,
On the holy mount stands the city he founded;
the Lord loves the gates of Zion
 Glorious things of you are spoken,
Among those who know me I mention Rahab and Babylon;
And of Zion it shall be said,
The Lord records as he registers the peoples,
 Singers and dancers alike say,
O Lord, God of my salvation,
Let my prayer come before you;
For my soul is full of troubles,
I am counted among those who go down to the pit;
like one set loose among the dead,
You have put me in the depths of the pit,
Your wrath lies heavy upon me,
You have caused my companions to shun me;
 my eye grows dim through sorrow.
Do you work wonders for the dead?
Is your steadfast love declared in the grave,
Are your wonders known in the darkness,
But I, O Lord, cry to you;
O Lord, why do you cast my soul away?
Afflicted and close to death from my youth up,
Your wrath has swept over me;
They surround me like a flood all day long;
You have caused my beloved and my friend to shun me;
 I will sing of the steadfast love of the Lord, forever;
For I said, “Steadfast love will be built up forever;
You have said, “I have made a covenant with my chosen one;
‘I will establish your offspring forever,
Let the heavens praise your wonders, O Lord,
For who in the skies can be compared to the Lord?
a God greatly to be feared in the council of the holy ones,
O Lord God of hosts,
You rule the raging of the sea;
You crushed Rahab like a carcass;
 The heavens are yours; the earth also is yours;
 The north and the south, you have created them;
You have a mighty arm;
 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne;
Blessed are the people who know the festal shout,
who exult in your name all the day
For you are the glory of their strength;
For our shield belongs to the Lord,
 Of old you spoke in a vision to your godly one, and said:
 I have found David, my servant;
so that my hand shall be established with him;
The enemy shall not outwit him;
I will crush his foes before him
My faithfulness and my steadfast love shall be with him,
I will set his hand on the sea
He shall cry to me, ‘You are my Father,
And I will make him the firstborn,
My steadfast love I will keep for him forever,
I will establish his offspring forever
 If his children forsake my law
if they violate my statutes
then I will punish their transgression with the rod
but I will not remove from him my steadfast love
I will not violate my covenant
Once for all I have sworn by my holiness;
His offspring shall endure forever,
Like the moon it shall be established forever,
But now you have cast off and rejected;
You have renounced the covenant with your servant;
You have breached all his walls;
 All who pass by plunder him;
You have exalted the right hand of his foes;
You have also turned back the edge of his sword,
You have made his splendor to cease
You have cut short the days of his youth;
 How long, O Lord? Will you hide yourself forever?
 Remember how short my time is!
 What man can live and never see death?
Lord, where is your steadfast love of old,
 Remember, O Lord, how your servants are mocked,
with which your enemies mock, O Lord,
 Blessed be the Lord forever!
Lord, you have been our dwelling place
 Before the mountains were brought forth,
You return man to dust
For a thousand years in your sight
You sweep them away as with a flood; they are like a dream,
in the morning it flourishes and is renewed;
For we are brought to an end by your anger;
You have set our iniquities before you,
For all our days pass away under your wrath;
The years of our life are seventy,
Who considers the power of your anger,
 So teach us to number our days
 Return, O Lord! How long?
Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love,
Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us,
Let your work be shown to your servants,
Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us,
He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High
I will say to the Lord, “My refuge and my fortress,
For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler
He will cover you with his pinions,
 You will not fear the terror of the night,
nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness,
A thousand may fall at your side,
You will only look with your eyes
Because you have made the Lord your dwelling place—
 no evil shall be allowed to befall you,
 For he will command his angels concerning you
On their hands they will bear you up,
You will tread on the lion and the adder;
“Because he holds fast to me in love, I will deliver him;
When he calls to me, I will answer him;
With long life I will satisfy him
 It is good to give thanks to the Lord,
to declare your steadfast love in the morning,
to the music of the lute and the harp,
For you, O Lord, have made me glad by your work;
How great are your works, O Lord!
The stupid man cannot know;
that though the wicked sprout like grass
but you, O Lord, are on high forever.
For behold, your enemies, O Lord,
But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox;
My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies;
 The righteous flourish like the palm tree
They are planted in the house of the Lord;
They still bear fruit in old age;
 to declare that the Lord is upright;
 The Lord reigns; he is robed in majesty;
 Your throne is established from of old;
 The floods have lifted up, O Lord,
Mightier than the thunders of many waters,
Your decrees are very trustworthy;
O Lord, God of vengeance,
 Rise up, O judge of the earth;
O Lord, how long shall the wicked,
They pour out their arrogant words;
They crush your people, O Lord,
They kill the widow and the sojourner,
 and they say, “The Lord does not see;
 Understand, O dullest of the people!
 He who planted the ear, does he not hear?
He who disciplines the nations, does he not rebuke?
 the Lord—knows the thoughts of man,
 Blessed is the man whom you discipline, O Lord,
to give him rest from days of trouble,
 For the Lord will not forsake his people;
for justice will return to the righteous,
 Who rises up for me against the wicked?
 If the Lord had not been my help,
When I thought, “My foot slips,”
When the cares of my heart are many,
Can wicked rulers be allied with you,
They band together against the life of the righteous
But the Lord has become my stronghold,
He will bring back on them their iniquity
Oh come, let us sing to the Lord;
Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving;
For the Lord is a great God,
In his hand are the depths of the earth;
The sea is his, for he made it,
Oh come, let us worship and bow down;
For he is our God,
 do not harden your hearts, as at Meribah,
when your fathers put me to the test
 For forty years I loathed that generation
Therefore I swore in my wrath,
 Oh sing to the Lord a new song;
Sing to the Lord, bless his name;
Declare his glory among the nations,
For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised;
For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols,
Splendor and majesty are before him;
Ascribe to the Lord, O families of the peoples,
Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name;
Worship the Lord in the splendor of holiness;
Say among the nations, “The Lord reigns!
Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice;
let the field exult, and everything in it!
before the Lord, for he comes,
 The Lord reigns, let the earth rejoice;
 Clouds and thick darkness are all around him;
 Fire goes before him
His lightnings light up the world;
The mountains melt like wax before the Lord,
 The heavens proclaim his righteousness,
All worshipers of images are put to shame,
Zion hears and is glad,
For you, O Lord, are most high over all the earth;
O you who love the Lord, hate evil!
 Light is sown for the righteous,
 Rejoice in the Lord, O you righteous,
Oh sing to the Lord a new song,
The Lord has made known his salvation;
He has remembered his steadfast love and faithfulness
 Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth;
Sing praises to the Lord with the lyre,
With trumpets and the sound of the horn
 Let the sea roar, and all that fills it;
Let the rivers clap their hands;
before the Lord, for he comes
 The Lord reigns; let the peoples tremble!
The Lord is great in Zion;
Let them praise your great and awesome name!
 The King in his might loves justice.
 Exalt the Lord our God;
 Moses and Aaron were among his priests,
In the pillar of the cloud he spoke to them;
O Lord our God, you answered them;
Exalt the Lord our God,
 Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth!
 Serve the Lord with gladness!
Know that the Lord, he is God!
 Enter his gates with thanksgiving,
 For the Lord is good;
I will sing of steadfast love and justice;
I will ponder the way that is blameless.
I will not set before my eyes
 A perverse heart shall be far from me;
Whoever slanders his neighbor secretly
I will look with favor on the faithful in the land,
No one who practices deceit
 Morning by morning I will destroy
 Hear my prayer, O Lord;
 Do not hide your face from me
For my days pass away like smoke,
My heart is struck down like grass and has withered;
Because of my loud groaning
I am like a desert owl of the wilderness,
I lie awake;
All the day my enemies taunt me;
For I eat ashes like bread
because of your indignation and anger;
My days are like an evening shadow;
But you, O Lord, are enthroned forever;
You will arise and have pity on Zion;
For your servants hold her stones dear
Nations will fear the name of the Lord,
For the Lord builds up Zion;
he regards the prayer of the destitute
Let this be recorded for a generation to come,
that he looked down from his holy height;
to hear the groans of the prisoners,
that they may declare in Zion the name of the Lord,
when peoples gather together,
He has broken my strength in midcourse;
“O my God,” I say, “take me not away
 Of old you laid the foundation of the earth,
 They will perish, but you will remain;
but you are the same, and your years have no end.
 The children of your servants shall dwell secure;
 Bless the Lord, O my soul,
 Bless the Lord, O my soul,
who forgives all your iniquity,
who redeems your life from the pit,
who satisfies you with good
The Lord works righteousness
He made known his ways to Moses,
The Lord is merciful and gracious,
 He will not always chide,
He does not deal with us according to our sins,
For as high as the heavens are above the earth,
as far as the east is from the west,
As a father shows compassion to his children,
For he knows our frame;
As for man, his days are like grass;
for the wind passes over it, and it is gone,
But the steadfast love of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him,
to those who keep his covenant
The Lord has established his throne in the heavens,
Bless the Lord, O you his angels,
Bless the Lord, all his hosts,
 Bless the Lord, all his works,
 Bless the Lord, O my soul!
covering yourself with light as with a garment,
He lays the beams of his chambers on the waters;
he makes his messengers winds,
He set the earth on its foundations,
You covered it with the deep as with a garment;
At your rebuke they fled;
The mountains rose, the valleys sank down
You set a boundary that they may not pass,
You make springs gush forth in the valleys;
they give drink to every beast of the field;
Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell;
 From your lofty abode you water the mountains;
You cause the grass to grow for the livestock
and wine to gladden the heart of man,
The trees of the Lord are watered abundantly,
In them the birds build their nests;
The high mountains are for the wild goats;
He made the moon to mark the seasons;
 You make darkness, and it is night,
 The young lions roar for their prey,
When the sun rises, they steal away
 Man goes out to his work
O Lord, how manifold are your works!
Here is the sea, great and wide,
There go the ships,
These all look to you,
When you give it to them, they gather it up;
When you hide your face, they are dismayed;
When you send forth your Spirit, they are created,
May the glory of the Lord endure forever;
who looks on the earth and it trembles,
I will sing to the Lord as long as I live;
May my meditation be pleasing to him,
Let sinners be consumed from the earth,
 Oh give thanks to the Lord; call upon his name;
Sing to him, sing praises to him;
Glory in his holy name;
Seek the Lord and his strength;
Remember the wondrous works that he has done,
O offspring of Abraham, his servant,
He is the Lord our God;
He remembers his covenant forever,
 the covenant that he made with Abraham,
which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute,
saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan
When they were few in number,
wandering from nation to nation,
he allowed no one to oppress them;
saying, “Touch not my anointed ones,
When he summoned a famine on the land
he had sent a man ahead of them,
His feet were hurt with fetters;
until what he had said came to pass,
 The king sent and released him;
he made him lord of his house
to bind his princes at his pleasure
Then Israel came to Egypt;
And the Lord made his people very fruitful
He turned their hearts to hate his people,
He sent Moses, his servant,
 They performed his signs among them
He sent darkness, and made the land dark;
He turned their waters into blood
Their land swarmed with frogs,
He spoke, and there came swarms of flies,
He gave them hail for rain,
He struck down their vines and fig trees,
He spoke, and the locusts came,
which devoured all the vegetation in their land
He struck down all the firstborn in their land,
Then he brought out Israel with silver and gold,
 Egypt was glad when they departed,
He spread a cloud for a covering,
 They asked, and he brought quail,
He opened the rock, and water gushed out;
For he remembered his holy promise,
So he brought his people out with joy,
And he gave them the lands of the nations,
that they might keep his statutes
 Praise the Lord!
Who can utter the mighty deeds of the Lord,
Blessed are they who observe justice,
 Remember me, O Lord, when you show favor to your people;
that I may look upon the prosperity of your chosen ones,
 Both we and our fathers have sinned;
Our fathers, when they were in Egypt,
Yet he saved them for his name’s sake,
He rebuked the Red Sea, and it became dry,
So he saved them from the hand of the foe
And the waters covered their adversaries;
Then they believed his words;
But they soon forgot his works;
But they had a wanton craving in the wilderness,
he gave them what they asked,
When men in the camp were jealous of Moses
 the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
 Fire also broke out in their company;
They made a calf in Horeb
They exchanged the glory of God
They forgot God, their Savior,
wondrous works in the land of Ham,
Therefore he said he would destroy them—
Then they despised the pleasant land,
They murmured in their tents,
Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them
and would make their offspring fall among the nations,
Then they yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor,
they provoked the Lord to anger with their deeds,
Then Phinehas stood up and intervened,
And that was counted to him as righteousness
They angered him at the waters of Meribah,
for they made his spirit bitter,
They did not destroy the peoples,
but they mixed with the nations
They served their idols,
They sacrificed their sons
they poured out innocent blood,
Thus they became unclean by their acts,
Then the anger of the Lord was kindled against his people,
he gave them into the hand of the nations,
Their enemies oppressed them,
 Many times he delivered them,
Nevertheless, he looked upon their distress,
For their sake he remembered his covenant,
He caused them to be pitied
 Save us, O Lord our God,
 Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,
 Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good,
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so,
and gathered in from the lands,
Some wandered in desert wastes,
hungry and thirsty,
Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,
He led them by a straight way
 Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love,
For he satisfies the longing soul,
 Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,
for they had rebelled against the words of God,
So he bowed their hearts down with hard labor;
 Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,
He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
 Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love,
For he shatters the doors of bronze
Some were fools through their sinful ways,
 they loathed any kind of food,
 Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,
He sent out his word and healed them,
 Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love,
And let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving,
Some went down to the sea in ships,
they saw the deeds of the Lord,
For he commanded and raised the stormy wind,
They mounted up to heaven; they went down to the depths;
they reeled and staggered like drunken men
 Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,
He made the storm be still,
Then they were glad that the waters were quiet,
 Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love,
Let them extol him in the congregation of the people,
He turns rivers into a desert,
 a fruitful land into a salty waste,
He turns a desert into pools of water,
And there he lets the hungry dwell,
they sow fields and plant vineyards
 By his blessing they multiply greatly,
When they are diminished and brought low
 he pours contempt on princes
but he raises up the needy out of affliction
 The upright see it and are glad,
 Whoever is wise, let him attend to these things;
 My heart is steadfast, O God!
Awake, O harp and lyre!
I will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples;
For your steadfast love is great above the heavens;
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens!
 That your beloved ones may be delivered,
God has promised in his holiness:
Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine;
Moab is my washbasin;
Who will bring me to the fortified city?
Have you not rejected us, O God?
Oh grant us help against the foe,
With God we shall do valiantly;
 Be not silent, O God of my praise!
For wicked and deceitful mouths are opened against me,
They encircle me with words of hate,
In return for my love they accuse me,
So they reward me evil for good,
 Appoint a wicked man against him;
When he is tried, let him come forth guilty;
May his days be few;
May his children be fatherless
May his children wander about and beg,
May the creditor seize all that he has;
Let there be none to extend kindness to him,
May his posterity be cut off;
May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord,
 Let them be before the Lord continually,
For he did not remember to show kindness,
 He loved to curse; let curses come upon him!
He clothed himself with cursing as his coat;
May it be like a garment that he wraps around him,
May this be the reward of my accusers from the Lord,
But you, O God my Lord,
For I am poor and needy,
I am gone like a shadow at evening;
My knees are weak through fasting;
I am an object of scorn to my accusers;
 Help me, O Lord my God!
Let them know that this is your hand;
 Let them curse, but you will bless!
May my accusers be clothed with dishonor;
With my mouth I will give great thanks to the Lord;
For he stands at the right hand of the needy one,
 The Lord says to my Lord:
The Lord sends forth from Zion
 Your people will offer themselves freely
 The Lord has sworn
The Lord is at your right hand;
He will execute judgment among the nations,
He will drink from the brook by the way;
  Praise the Lord!
Great are the works of the Lord,
 Full of splendor and majesty is his work,
He has caused his wondrous works to be remembered;
He provides food for those who fear him;
He has shown his people the power of his works,
The works of his hands are faithful and just;
they are established forever and ever,
He sent redemption to his people;
 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom;
  Praise the Lord!
His offspring will be mighty in the land;
 Wealth and riches are in his house,
Light dawns in the darkness for the upright;
It is well with the man who deals generously and lends;
For the righteous will never be moved;
He is not afraid of bad news;
His heart is steady; he will not be afraid,
He has distributed freely; he has given to the poor;
The wicked man sees it and is angry;

 Who is like the Lord our God,
who looks far down
He raises the poor from the dust
to make them sit with princes,
He gives the barren woman a home,
When Israel went out from Egypt,
Judah became his sanctuary,
 The sea looked and fled;
 The mountains skipped like rams,
What ails you, O sea, that you flee?
O mountains, that you skip like rams?

who turns the rock into a pool of water,

 Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to your name give glory,
Why should the nations say,
 Our God is in the heavens;
 Their idols are silver and gold,
They have mouths, but do not speak;
They have ears, but do not hear;
They have hands, but do not feel;
 Those who make them become like them;
O Israel, trust in the Lord!
I love the Lord, because he has heard
Because he inclined his ear to me,
 The snares of death encompassed me;
Then I called on the name of the Lord:
 Gracious is the Lord, and righteous;
The Lord preserves the simple;
Return, O my soul, to your rest;
For you have delivered my soul from death,
I will walk before the Lord
 I believed, even when I spoke:
 I said in my alarm,
What shall I render to the Lord
I will lift up the cup of salvation
I will pay my vows to the Lord
 Precious in the sight of the Lord

 Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;

 Out of my distress I called on the Lord;
 The Lord is on my side; I will not fear.
 The Lord is on my side as my helper;
 It is better to take refuge in the Lord
It is better to take refuge in the Lord
 All nations surrounded me;
They surrounded me, surrounded me on every side;
 They surrounded me like bees;
I was pushed hard, so that I was falling,
The Lord is my strength and my song;
Glad songs of salvation
the right hand of the Lord exalts,
 I shall not die, but I shall live,
The Lord has disciplined me severely,
 Open to me the gates of righteousness,
This is the gate of the Lord;
I thank you that you have answered me
  Blessed are those whose way is blameless,
Blessed are those who keep his testimonies,
who also do no wrong,
You have commanded your precepts
Oh that my ways may be steadfast
 Then I shall not be put to shame,
I will praise you with an upright heart,
I will keep your statutes;
How can a young man keep his way pure?
 With my whole heart I seek you;
I have stored up your word in my heart,
Blessed are you, O Lord;
With my lips I declare
In the way of your testimonies I delight
I will meditate on your precepts
I will delight in your statutes;
 Deal bountifully with your servant,
Open my eyes, that I may behold
I am a sojourner on the earth;
My soul is consumed with longing
You rebuke the insolent, accursed ones,
Take away from me scorn and contempt,
Even though princes sit plotting against me,
Your testimonies are my delight;
 My soul clings to the dust;
When I told of my ways, you answered me;
 Make me understand the way of your precepts,
 My soul melts away for sorrow;
Put false ways far from me
I have chosen the way of faithfulness;
I cling to your testimonies, O Lord;
I will run in the way of your commandments
 Teach me, O Lord, the way of your statutes;
 Give me understanding, that I may keep your law
 Lead me in the path of your commandments,
 Incline my heart to your testimonies,
 Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things;
 Confirm to your servant your promise,
Turn away the reproach that I dread,
Behold, I long for your precepts;
Let your steadfast love come to me, O Lord,
then shall I have an answer for him who taunts me,
And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth,
I will keep your law continually,
and I shall walk in a wide place,
I will also speak of your testimonies before kings
for I find my delight in your commandments,
I will lift up my hands toward your commandments, which I love,
Remember your word to your servant,
This is my comfort in my affliction,
 The insolent utterly deride me,
When I think of your rules from of old,
 Hot indignation seizes me because of the wicked,
Your statutes have been my songs
I remember your name in the night, O Lord,
This blessing has fallen to me,
 The Lord is my portion;
I entreat your favor with all my heart;
When I think on my ways,
I hasten and do not delay
Though the cords of the wicked ensnare me,
At midnight I rise to praise you,
 I am a companion of all who fear you,
 The earth, O Lord, is full of your steadfast love;
You have dealt well with your servant,
Teach me good judgment and knowledge,
 Before I was afflicted I went astray,
 You are good and do good;
 The insolent smear me with lies,
their heart is unfeeling like fat,
It is good for me that I was afflicted,
 The law of your mouth is better to me
In my distress I called to the Lord,
Deliver me, O Lord,
What shall be given to you,
 A warrior’s sharp arrows,
Woe to me, that I sojourn in Meshech,
Too long have I had my dwelling
 I am for peace,

I will not give sleep to my eyes
until I find a place for the Lord,
Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah;
“Let us go to his dwelling place;
 Arise, O Lord, and go to your resting place,
Let your priests be clothed with righteousness,
For the sake of your servant David,
 The Lord swore to David a sure oath
If your sons keep my covenant
For the Lord has chosen Zion;

I will abundantly bless her provisions;

For the Lord has chosen Jacob for himself,
For I know that the Lord is great,
 Whatever the Lord pleases, he does,
 He it is who makes the clouds rise at the end of the earth,
He it was who struck down the firstborn of Egypt,
who in your midst, O Egypt,
 who struck down many nations
 Sihon, king of the Amorites,
and gave their land as a heritage,
 Your name, O Lord, endures forever,
 For the Lord will vindicate his people
 The idols of the nations are silver and gold,
They have mouths, but do not speak;
they have ears, but do not hear,

Give thanks to the God of gods,
Give thanks to the Lord of lords,
to him who alone does great wonders,
to him who by understanding made the heavens,
to him who spread out the earth above the waters,
to him who made the great lights,
the sun to rule over the day,
the moon and stars to rule over the night,
to him who struck down the firstborn of Egypt,
and brought Israel out from among them,
with a strong hand and an outstretched arm,
to him who divided the Red Sea in two,
 and made Israel pass through the midst of it,
By the waters of Babylon,
On the willows there
For there our captors
 How shall we sing the Lord’s song
If I forget you, O Jerusalem,
Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth,
Remember, O Lord, against the Edomites
O daughter of Babylon, doomed to be destroyed,
Blessed shall he be who takes your little ones
 I give you thanks, O Lord, with my whole heart;
I bow down toward your holy temple
On the day I called, you answered me;
 All the kings of the earth shall give you thanks, O Lord,
and they shall sing of the ways of the Lord,
 For though the Lord is high, he regards the lowly,
 Though I walk in the midst of trouble,
The Lord will fulfill his purpose for me;

O Lord, you have searched me and known me!
You know when I sit down and when I rise up;
You search out my path and my lying down
Even before a word is on my tongue,
You hem me in, behind and before,
 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;
 Where shall I go from your Spirit?
 If I ascend to heaven, you are there!
If I take the wings of the morning
even there your hand shall lead me,
If I say, “Surely the darkness shall cover me,
 even the darkness is not dark to you;
For you formed my inward parts;
I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
 Deliver me, O Lord, from evil men;
who plan evil things in their heart
They make their tongue sharp as a serpent’s,
Guard me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked;
The arrogant have hidden a trap for me,
 I say to the Lord, You are my God;
O Lord, my Lord, the strength of my salvation,
 Grant not, O Lord, the desires of the wicked;
As for the head of those who surround me,
Let burning coals fall upon them!
Let not the slanderer be established in the land;
I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
Surely the righteous shall give thanks to your name;

O Lord, I call upon you; hasten to me!
Let my prayer be counted as incense before you,
 Set a guard, O Lord, over my mouth;
 Do not let my heart incline to any evil,
 Let a righteous man strike me—it is a kindness;
When their judges are thrown over the cliff,
As when one plows and breaks up the earth,
But my eyes are toward you, O God, my Lord;
Keep me from the trap that they have laid for me
Let the wicked fall into their own nets,

With my voice I cry out to the Lord;
I pour out my complaint before him;
When my spirit faints within me,
 Look to the right and see:
I cry to you, O Lord;
 Attend to my cry,
Hear my prayer, O Lord;
 Enter not into judgment with your servant,
For the enemy has pursued my soul;
Therefore my spirit faints within me;
 I remember the days of old;
 I stretch out my hands to you;
 Answer me quickly, O Lord!
 Let me hear in the morning of your steadfast love,
 Deliver me from my enemies, O Lord!
 Teach me to do your will,
 For your name’s sake, O Lord, preserve my life!
And in your steadfast love you will cut off my enemies,
Blessed be the Lord, my rock,
he is my steadfast love and my fortress,
O Lord, what is man that you regard him,
 Man is like a breath;
 Bow your heavens, O Lord, and come down!
 Flash forth the lightning and scatter them;
 Stretch out your hand from on high;
whose mouths speak lies
I will sing a new song to you, O God;
who gives victory to kings,
Rescue me and deliver me
May our sons in their youth
 may our granaries be full,
may our cattle be heavy with young,
 Blessed are the people to whom such blessings fall!

 I will extol you, my God and King,
Every day I will bless you
 Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised,
 One generation shall commend your works to another,
On the glorious splendor of your majesty,
They shall speak of the might of your awesome deeds,
They shall pour forth the fame of your abundant goodness
The Lord is gracious and merciful,
The Lord is good to all,
 Praise the Lord!
I will praise the Lord as long as I live;
 Put not your trust in princes,
When his breath departs, he returns to the earth;
 Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob,
 who made heaven and earth,
 who executes justice for the oppressed,
 the Lord opens the eyes of the blind.
 The Lord watches over the sojourners;
 Praise the Lord!
The Lord builds up Jerusalem;
He heals the brokenhearted
He determines the number of the stars;
 Great is our Lord, and abundant in power;
 Praise the Lord!
Praise him, all his angels;
Praise him, sun and moon,
Praise him, you highest heavens,
 Let them praise the name of the Lord!
And he established them forever and ever;
Praise the Lord from the earth,
 fire and hail, snow and mist,
 Mountains and all hills,
 Beasts and all livestock,
Kings of the earth and all peoples,
 Praise the Lord!
Let Israel be glad in his Maker;
Let them praise his name with dancing,
For the Lord takes pleasure in his people;
Let the godly exult in glory;
Let the high praises of God be in their throats
to execute vengeance on the nations
to bind their kings with chains
to execute on them the judgment written!

Let everything that has breath praise the Lord!
