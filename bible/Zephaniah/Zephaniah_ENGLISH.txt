The word of the Lord that came to Zephaniah the son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.
 “I will utterly sweep away everything
“I will sweep away man and beast;
“I will stretch out my hand against Judah
 those who bow down on the roofs
 those who have turned back from following the Lord,
 Be silent before the Lord God!
And on the day of the Lord’s sacrifice—
On that day I will punish
“On that day,” declares the Lord,
 Wail, O inhabitants of the Mortar!
At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps,
Their goods shall be plundered,
 The great day of the Lord is near,
 A day of wrath is that day,
 a day of trumpet blast and battle cry
 I will bring distress on mankind,
 Neither their silver nor their gold
Gather together, yes, gather,
 before the decree takes effect
 Seek the Lord, all you humble of the land,
 For Gaza shall be deserted,
Woe to you inhabitants of the seacoast,
 And you, O seacoast, shall be pastures,
 The seacoast shall become the possession
“I have heard the taunts of Moab
Therefore, as I live,” declares the Lord of hosts,
This shall be their lot in return for their pride,
The Lord will be awesome against them;
 You also, O Cushites,
And he will stretch out his hand against the north
 Herds shall lie down in her midst,
This is the exultant city
Woe to her who is rebellious and defiled,
She listens to no voice;
 Her officials within her
 Her prophets are fickle, treacherous men;
The Lord within her is righteous;
 “I have cut off nations;
 I said, ‘Surely you will fear me;
“Therefore wait for me,” declares the Lord,
“For at that time I will change the speech of the peoples
 From beyond the rivers of Cush
 “On that day you shall not be put to shame
But I will leave in your midst
 those who are left in Israel;
 Sing aloud, O daughter of Zion;
The Lord has taken away the judgments against you;
 On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem:
 The Lord your God is in your midst,
I will gather those of you who mourn for the festival,
Behold, at that time I will deal
 At that time I will bring you in,
