 The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:
To know wisdom and instruction,
to receive instruction in wise dealing,
to give prudence to the simple,
Let the wise hear and increase in learning,
to understand a proverb and a saying,
 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge;
 Hear, my son, your father’s instruction,
for they are a graceful garland for your head
My son, if sinners entice you,
If they say, “Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood;
like Sheol let us swallow them alive,
we shall find all precious goods,
throw in your lot among us;
my son, do not walk in the way with them;
for their feet run to evil,
 For in vain is a net spread
but these men lie in wait for their own blood;
 Such are the ways of everyone who is greedy for unjust gain;
 Wisdom cries aloud in the street,
at the head of the noisy streets she cries out;
“How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple?
If you turn at my reproof,
 Because I have called and you refused to listen,
because you have ignored all my counsel
I also will laugh at your calamity;
when terror strikes you like a storm
 Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer;
Because they hated knowledge
 would have none of my counsel
therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way,
For the simple are killed by their turning away,
but whoever listens to me will dwell secure
 My son, if you receive my words
making your ear attentive to wisdom
yes, if you call out for insight
if you seek it like silver
then you will understand the fear of the Lord
For the Lord gives wisdom;
he stores up sound wisdom for the upright;
guarding the paths of justice
 Then you will understand righteousness and justice
for wisdom will come into your heart,
 discretion will watch over you,
delivering you from the way of evil,
who forsake the paths of uprightness
who rejoice in doing evil
men whose paths are crooked,
So you will be delivered from the forbidden woman,
who forsakes the companion of her youth
 for her house sinks down to death,
none who go to her come back,
So you will walk in the way of the good
For the upright will inhabit the land,
but the wicked will be cut off from the land,
 My son, do not forget my teaching,
for length of days and years of life
Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you;
So you will find favor and good success
 Trust in the Lord with all your heart,
In all your ways acknowledge him,
 Be not wise in your own eyes;
It will be healing to your flesh
Honor the Lord with your wealth
then your barns will be filled with plenty,
 My son, do not despise the Lord’s discipline
for the Lord reproves him whom he loves,
 Blessed is the one who finds wisdom,
 for the gain from her is better than gain from silver
She is more precious than jewels,
 Long life is in her right hand;
Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her;
 The Lord by wisdom founded the earth;
by his knowledge the deeps broke open,
My son, do not lose sight of these—
and they will be life for your soul
 Then you will walk on your way securely,
 If you lie down, you will not be afraid;
 Do not be afraid of sudden terror
for the Lord will be your confidence
 Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,
 Do not say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again,
 Do not plan evil against your neighbor,
 Do not contend with a man for no reason,
 Do not envy a man of violence
for the devious person is an abomination to the Lord,
 The Lord’s curse is on the house of the wicked,
Toward the scorners he is scornful,
The wise will inherit honor,
 Hear, O sons, a father’s instruction,
for I give you good precepts;
When I was a son with my father,
he taught me and said to me,
 Get wisdom; get insight;
Do not forsake her, and she will keep you;
 The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom,
Prize her highly, and she will exalt you;
She will place on your head a graceful garland;
 Hear, my son, and accept my words,
I have taught you the way of wisdom;
When you walk, your step will not be hampered,
 Keep hold of instruction; do not let go;
 Do not enter the path of the wicked,
Avoid it; do not go on it;
For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong;
For they eat the bread of wickedness
But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn,
 The way of the wicked is like deep darkness;
 My son, be attentive to my words;
 Let them not escape from your sight;
For they are life to those who find them,
Keep your heart with all vigilance,
Put away from you crooked speech,
 Let your eyes look directly forward,
 Ponder the path of your feet;
 Do not swerve to the right or to the left;
 My son, be attentive to my wisdom;
that you may keep discretion,
For the lips of a forbidden woman drip honey,
but in the end she is bitter as wormwood,
Her feet go down to death;
she does not ponder the path of life;
And now, O sons, listen to me,
Keep your way far from her,
lest you give your honor to others
lest strangers take their fill of your strength,
and at the end of your life you groan,
and you say, “How I hated discipline,
I did not listen to the voice of my teachers
 I am at the brink of utter ruin
Drink water from your own cistern,
Should your springs be scattered abroad,
 Let them be for yourself alone,
Let your fountain be blessed,
a lovely deer, a graceful doe.
Why should you be intoxicated, my son, with a forbidden woman
For a man’s ways are before the eyes of the Lord,
The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him,
 He dies for lack of discipline,
My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor,
if you are snared in the words of your mouth,
then do this, my son, and save yourself,
 Give your eyes no sleep
save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,
 Go to the ant, O sluggard;
 Without having any chief,
she prepares her bread in summer
 How long will you lie there, O sluggard?
 A little sleep, a little slumber,
 and poverty will come upon you like a robber,
 A worthless person, a wicked man,
 winks with his eyes, signals with his feet,
with perverted heart devises evil,
therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly;
There are six things that the Lord hates,
 haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
 a heart that devises wicked plans,
 a false witness who breathes out lies,
 My son, keep your father’s commandment,
 Bind them on your heart always;
 When you walk, they will lead you;
For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light,
to preserve you from the evil woman,
 Do not desire her beauty in your heart,
for the price of a prostitute is only a loaf of bread,
Can a man carry fire next to his chest
Or can one walk on hot coals
So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife;
People do not despise a thief if he steals
but if he is caught, he will pay sevenfold;
He who commits adultery lacks sense;
He will get wounds and dishonor,
For jealousy makes a man furious,
He will accept no compensation;
 My son, keep my words
 keep my commandments and live;
 bind them on your fingers;
Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”
to keep you from the forbidden woman,
For at the window of my house
and I have seen among the simple,
passing along the street near her corner,
in the twilight, in the evening,
And behold, the woman meets him,
She is loud and wayward;
now in the street, now in the market,
She seizes him and kisses him,
“I had to offer sacrifices,
so now I have come out to meet you,
I have spread my couch with coverings,
I have perfumed my bed with myrrh,
Come, let us take our fill of love till morning;
For my husband is not at home;
he took a bag of money with him;
With much seductive speech she persuades him;
All at once he follows her,
till an arrow pierces its liver;
And now, O sons, listen to me,
Let not your heart turn aside to her ways;
for many a victim has she laid low,
Her house is the way to Sheol,
Does not wisdom call?
On the heights beside the way,
beside the gates in front of the town,
“To you, O men, I call,
O simple ones, learn prudence;
Hear, for I will speak noble things,
for my mouth will utter truth;
All the words of my mouth are righteous;
They are all straight to him who understands,
 Take my instruction instead of silver,
 for wisdom is better than jewels,
“I, wisdom, dwell with prudence,
 The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil.
I have counsel and sound wisdom;
By me kings reign,
by me princes rule,
 I love those who love me,
 Riches and honor are with me,
My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold,
I walk in the way of righteousness,
granting an inheritance to those who love me,
 “The Lord possessed me at the beginning of his work,
Ages ago I was set up,
When there were no depths I was brought forth,
Before the mountains had been shaped,
before he had made the earth with its fields,
When he established the heavens, I was there;
when he made firm the skies above,
when he assigned to the sea its limit,
then I was beside him, like a master workman,
 rejoicing in his inhabited world
“And now, O sons, listen to me:
 Hear instruction and be wise,
 Blessed is the one who listens to me,
For whoever finds me finds life
but he who fails to find me injures himself;
 Wisdom has built her house;
She has slaughtered her beasts; she has mixed her wine;
She has sent out her young women to call
 “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”
“Come, eat of my bread
Leave your simple ways, and live,
Whoever corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse,
 Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you;
Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser;
 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,
For by me your days will be multiplied,
 If you are wise, you are wise for yourself;
 The woman Folly is loud;
She sits at the door of her house;
calling to those who pass by,
 “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”
 “Stolen water is sweet,
But he does not know that the dead are there,
 The proverbs of Solomon.
 Treasures gained by wickedness do not profit,
 The Lord does not let the righteous go hungry,
A slack hand causes poverty,
He who gathers in summer is a prudent son,
Blessings are on the head of the righteous,
 The memory of the righteous is a blessing,
 The wise of heart will receive commandments,
 Whoever walks in integrity walks securely,
Whoever winks the eye causes trouble,
 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life,
Hatred stirs up strife,
On the lips of him who has understanding, wisdom is found,
The wise lay up knowledge,
 A rich man’s wealth is his strong city;
The wage of the righteous leads to life,
Whoever heeds instruction is on the path to life,
The one who conceals hatred has lying lips,
 When words are many, transgression is not lacking,
The tongue of the righteous is choice silver;
The lips of the righteous feed many,
 The blessing of the Lord makes rich,
Doing wrong is like a joke to a fool,
 What the wicked dreads will come upon him,
When the tempest passes, the wicked is no more,
Like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes,
 The fear of the Lord prolongs life,
 The hope of the righteous brings joy,
 The way of the Lord is a stronghold to the blameless,
 The righteous will never be removed,
 The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom,
The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable,
 A false balance is an abomination to the Lord,
 When pride comes, then comes disgrace,
 The integrity of the upright guides them,
 Riches do not profit in the day of wrath,
The righteousness of the blameless keeps his way straight,
 The righteousness of the upright delivers them,
When the wicked dies, his hope will perish,
 The righteous is delivered from trouble,
With his mouth the godless man would destroy his neighbor,
 When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices,
By the blessing of the upright a city is exalted,
Whoever belittles his neighbor lacks sense,
Whoever goes about slandering reveals secrets,
Where there is no guidance, a people falls,
 Whoever puts up security for a stranger will surely suffer harm,
 A gracious woman gets honor,
 A man who is kind benefits himself,
The wicked earns deceptive wages,
Whoever is steadfast in righteousness will live,
Those of crooked heart are an abomination to the Lord,
 Be assured, an evil person will not go unpunished,
Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout
The desire of the righteous ends only in good,
 One gives freely, yet grows all the richer;
 Whoever brings blessing will be enriched,
 The people curse him who holds back grain,
Whoever diligently seeks good seeks favor,
Whoever trusts in his riches will fall,
Whoever troubles his own household will inherit the wind,
The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life,
If the righteous is repaid on earth,
Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge,
A good man obtains favor from the Lord,
No one is established by wickedness,
 An excellent wife is the crown of her husband,
 The thoughts of the righteous are just;
The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood,
 The wicked are overthrown and are no more,
A man is commended according to his good sense,
Better to be lowly and have a servant
 Whoever is righteous has regard for the life of his beast,
 Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread,
Whoever is wicked covets the spoil of evildoers,
An evil man is ensnared by the transgression of his lips,
From the fruit of his mouth a man is satisfied with good,
 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes,
 The vexation of a fool is known at once,
 Whoever speaks the truth gives honest evidence,
 There is one whose rash words are like sword thrusts,
Truthful lips endure forever,
Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil,
 No ill befalls the righteous,
 Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord,
 A prudent man conceals knowledge,
 The hand of the diligent will rule,
 Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs him down,
One who is righteous is a guide to his neighbor,
 Whoever is slothful will not roast his game,
 In the path of righteousness is life,
A wise son hears his father’s instruction,
From the fruit of his mouth a man eats what is good,
 Whoever guards his mouth preserves his life;
 The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing,
The righteous hates falsehood,
 Righteousness guards him whose way is blameless,
 One pretends to be rich, yet has nothing;
The ransom of a man’s life is his wealth,
 The light of the righteous rejoices,
 By insolence comes nothing but strife,
 Wealth gained hastily will dwindle,
Hope deferred makes the heart sick,
Whoever despises the word brings destruction on himself,
The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life,
 Good sense wins favor,
 Every prudent man acts with knowledge,
A wicked messenger falls into trouble,
Poverty and disgrace come to him who ignores instruction,
 A desire fulfilled is sweet to the soul,
Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise,
 Disaster pursues sinners,
 A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children,
The fallow ground of the poor would yield much food,
 Whoever spares the rod hates his son,
 The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite,
 The wisest of women builds her house,
Whoever walks in uprightness fears the Lord,
By the mouth of a fool comes a rod for his back,
Where there are no oxen, the manger is clean,
 A faithful witness does not lie,
 A scoffer seeks wisdom in vain,
Leave the presence of a fool,
The wisdom of the prudent is to discern his way,
 Fools mock at the guilt offering,
The heart knows its own bitterness,
 The house of the wicked will be destroyed,
 There is a way that seems right to a man,
Even in laughter the heart may ache,
The backslider in heart will be filled with the fruit of his ways,
 The simple believes everything,
 One who is wise is cautious and turns away from evil,
A man of quick temper acts foolishly,
The simple inherit folly,
 The evil bow down before the good,
 The poor is disliked even by his neighbor,
Whoever despises his neighbor is a sinner,
Do they not go astray who devise evil?
In all toil there is profit,
The crown of the wise is their wealth,
A truthful witness saves lives,
In the fear of the Lord one has strong confidence,
The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life,
In a multitude of people is the glory of a king,
Whoever is slow to anger has great understanding,
A tranquil heart gives life to the flesh,
Whoever oppresses a poor man insults his Maker,
 The wicked is overthrown through his evildoing,
Wisdom rests in the heart of a man of understanding,
Righteousness exalts a nation,
A servant who deals wisely has the king’s favor,
 A soft answer turns away wrath,
The tongue of the wise commends knowledge,
 The eyes of the Lord are in every place,
 A gentle tongue is a tree of life,
 A fool despises his father’s instruction,
In the house of the righteous there is much treasure,
 The lips of the wise spread knowledge;
 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,
The way of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,
There is severe discipline for him who forsakes the way;
Sheol and Abaddon lie open before the Lord;
 A scoffer does not like to be reproved;
 A glad heart makes a cheerful face,
 The heart of him who has understanding seeks knowledge,
All the days of the afflicted are evil,
 Better is a little with the fear of the Lord
 Better is a dinner of herbs where love is
 A hot-tempered man stirs up strife,
The way of a sluggard is like a hedge of thorns,
 A wise son makes a glad father,
 Folly is a joy to him who lacks sense,
 Without counsel plans fail,
To make an apt answer is a joy to a man,
The path of life leads upward for the prudent,
The Lord tears down the house of the proud
 The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the Lord,
Whoever is greedy for unjust gain troubles his own household,
The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer,
The Lord is far from the wicked,
 The light of the eyes rejoices the heart,
 The ear that listens to life-giving reproof
Whoever ignores instruction despises himself,
 The fear of the Lord is instruction in wisdom,
The plans of the heart belong to man,
 All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes,
 Commit your work to the Lord,
 The Lord has made everything for its purpose,
Everyone who is arrogant in heart is an abomination to the Lord;
By steadfast love and faithfulness iniquity is atoned for,
When a man’s ways please the Lord,
 Better is a little with righteousness
 The heart of man plans his way,
 An oracle is on the lips of a king;
 A just balance and scales are the Lord’s;
It is an abomination to kings to do evil,
 Righteous lips are the delight of a king,
 A king’s wrath is a messenger of death,
 In the light of a king’s face there is life,
 How much better to get wisdom than gold!
The highway of the upright turns aside from evil;
 Pride goes before destruction,
 It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor
Whoever gives thought to the word will discover good,
The wise of heart is called discerning,
Good sense is a fountain of life to him who has it,
 The heart of the wise makes his speech judicious
 Gracious words are like a honeycomb,
There is a way that seems right to a man,
A worker’s appetite works for him;
 A worthless man plots evil,
 A dishonest man spreads strife,
A man of violence entices his neighbor
Whoever winks his eyes plans dishonest things;
 Gray hair is a crown of glory;
 Whoever is slow to anger is better than the mighty,
 The lot is cast into the lap,
 Better is a dry morsel with quiet
A servant who deals wisely will rule over a son who acts shamefully
 The crucible is for silver, and the furnace is for gold,
An evildoer listens to wicked lips,
Whoever mocks the poor insults his Maker;
 Grandchildren are the crown of the aged,
Fine speech is not becoming to a fool;
 A bribe is like a magic stone in the eyes of the one who gives it;
Whoever covers an offense seeks love,
A rebuke goes deeper into a man of understanding
An evil man seeks only rebellion,
Let a man meet a she-bear robbed of her cubs
If anyone returns evil for good,
The beginning of strife is like letting out water,
He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the righteous
Why should a fool have money in his hand to buy wisdom
 A friend loves at all times,
One who lacks sense gives a pledge
Whoever loves transgression loves strife;
 A man of crooked heart does not discover good,
He who sires a fool gets himself sorrow,
 A joyful heart is good medicine,
The wicked accepts a bribe in secret
 The discerning sets his face toward wisdom,
 A foolish son is a grief to his father
 To impose a fine on a righteous man is not good,
Whoever restrains his words has knowledge,
Even a fool who keeps silent is considered wise;
Whoever isolates himself seeks his own desire;
A fool takes no pleasure in understanding,
When wickedness comes, contempt comes also,
The words of a man’s mouth are deep waters;
It is not good to be partial to the wicked
A fool’s lips walk into a fight,
 A fool’s mouth is his ruin,
 The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels;
Whoever is slack in his work
 The name of the Lord is a strong tower;
 A rich man’s wealth is his strong city,
 Before destruction a man’s heart is haughty,
If one gives an answer before he hears,
A man’s spirit will endure sickness,
An intelligent heart acquires knowledge,
A man’s gift makes room for him
The one who states his case first seems right,
 The lot puts an end to quarrels
A brother offended is more unyielding than a strong city,
 From the fruit of a man’s mouth his stomach is satisfied;
 Death and life are in the power of the tongue,
He who finds a wife finds a good thing
The poor use entreaties,
A man of many companions may come to ruin,
 Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity
Desire without knowledge is not good,
When a man’s folly brings his way to ruin,
 Wealth brings many new friends,
 A false witness will not go unpunished,
Many seek the favor of a generous man,
 All a poor man’s brothers hate him;
 Whoever gets sense loves his own soul;
 A false witness will not go unpunished,
 It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury,
 Good sense makes one slow to anger,
A king’s wrath is like the growling of a lion,
 A foolish son is ruin to his father,
 House and wealth are inherited from fathers,
 Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep,
Whoever keeps the commandment keeps his life;
 Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the Lord,
 Discipline your son, for there is hope;
A man of great wrath will pay the penalty,
Listen to advice and accept instruction,
 Many are the plans in the mind of a man,
What is desired in a man is steadfast love,
The fear of the Lord leads to life,
 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish
 Strike a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence;
He who does violence to his father and chases away his mother
Cease to hear instruction, my son,
A worthless witness mocks at justice,
Condemnation is ready for scoffers,
 Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler,
The terror of a king is like the growling of a lion;
It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife,
 The sluggard does not plow in the autumn;
The purpose in a man’s heart is like deep water,
Many a man proclaims his own steadfast love,
The righteous who walks in his integrity—
 A king who sits on the throne of judgment
 Who can say, “I have made my heart pure;
 Unequal weights and unequal measures
Even a child makes himself known by his acts,
 The hearing ear and the seeing eye,
 Love not sleep, lest you come to poverty;
“Bad, bad,” says the buyer,
There is gold and abundance of costly stones,
 Take a man’s garment when he has put up security for a stranger,
 Bread gained by deceit is sweet to a man,
 Plans are established by counsel;
Whoever goes about slandering reveals secrets;
 If one curses his father or his mother,
 An inheritance gained hastily in the beginning
Do not say, “I will repay evil”;
 Unequal weights are an abomination to the Lord,
A man’s steps are from the Lord;
It is a snare to say rashly, “It is holy,”
A wise king winnows the wicked
 The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord,
 Steadfast love and faithfulness preserve the king,
The glory of young men is their strength,
 Blows that wound cleanse away evil;
The king’s heart is a stream of water in the hand of the Lord;
 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes,
 To do righteousness and justice
 Haughty eyes and a proud heart,
The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance,
 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue
The violence of the wicked will sweep them away,
The way of the guilty is crooked,
It is better to live in a corner of the housetop
The soul of the wicked desires evil;
When a scoffer is punished, the simple becomes wise;
The Righteous One observes the house of the wicked;
 Whoever closes his ear to the cry of the poor
 A gift in secret averts anger,
When justice is done, it is a joy to the righteous
One who wanders from the way of good sense
Whoever loves pleasure will be a poor man;
 The wicked is a ransom for the righteous,
It is better to live in a desert land
 Precious treasure and oil are in a wise man’s dwelling,
Whoever pursues righteousness and kindness
 A wise man scales the city of the mighty
 Whoever keeps his mouth and his tongue
 “Scoffer” is the name of the arrogant, haughty man
The desire of the sluggard kills him,
All day long he craves and craves,
 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination;
 A false witness will perish,
A wicked man puts on a bold face,
 No wisdom, no understanding, no counsel
 The horse is made ready for the day of battle,
 A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches,
 The rich and the poor meet together;
 The prudent sees danger and hides himself,
The reward for humility and fear of the Lord
 Thorns and snares are in the way of the crooked;
 Train up a child in the way he should go;
 The rich rules over the poor,
Whoever sows injustice will reap calamity,
 Whoever has a bountiful eye will be blessed,
 Drive out a scoffer, and strife will go out,
He who loves purity of heart,
The eyes of the Lord keep watch over knowledge,
 The sluggard says, “There is a lion outside!
The mouth of forbidden women is a deep pit;
Folly is bound up in the heart of a child,
Whoever oppresses the poor to increase his own wealth,
 Incline your ear, and hear the words of the wise,
for it will be pleasant if you keep them within you,
That your trust may be in the Lord,
Have I not written for you thirty sayings
to make you know what is right and true,
 Do not rob the poor, because he is poor,
for the Lord will plead their cause
Make no friendship with a man given to anger,
lest you learn his ways
Be not one of those who give pledges,
If you have nothing with which to pay,
Do not move the ancient landmark
Do you see a man skillful in his work?
When you sit down to eat with a ruler,
and put a knife to your throat
 Do not desire his delicacies,
 Do not toil to acquire wealth;
When your eyes light on it, it is gone,
 Do not eat the bread of a man who is stingy;
for he is like one who is inwardly calculating.
You will vomit up the morsels that you have eaten,
Do not speak in the hearing of a fool,
 Do not move an ancient landmark
for their Redeemer is strong;
Apply your heart to instruction
Do not withhold discipline from a child;
If you strike him with the rod,
 My son, if your heart is wise,
My inmost being will exult
Let not your heart envy sinners,
Surely there is a future,
Hear, my son, and be wise,
Be not among drunkards
for the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty,
 Listen to your father who gave you life,
 Buy truth, and do not sell it;
 The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice;
 Let your father and mother be glad;
My son, give me your heart,
For a prostitute is a deep pit;
 She lies in wait like a robber
 Who has woe? Who has sorrow?
Those who tarry long over wine;
Do not look at wine when it is red,
In the end it bites like a serpent
Your eyes will see strange things,
You will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea,
“They struck me,” you will say, “but I was not hurt;
Be not envious of evil men,
for their hearts devise violence,
By wisdom a house is built,
by knowledge the rooms are filled
 A wise man is full of strength,
for by wise guidance you can wage your war,
Wisdom is too high for a fool;
Whoever plans to do evil
 The devising of folly is sin,
If you faint in the day of adversity,
 Rescue those who are being taken away to death;
If you say, “Behold, we did not know this,”
My son, eat honey, for it is good,
Know that wisdom is such to your soul;
 Lie not in wait as a wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous;
 for the righteous falls seven times and rises again,
 Do not rejoice when your enemy falls,
lest the Lord see it and be displeased,
 Fret not yourself because of evildoers,
for the evil man has no future;
My son, fear the Lord and the king,
for disaster will arise suddenly from them,
These also are sayings of the wise.
Whoever says to the wicked, “You are in the right,”
but those who rebuke the wicked will have delight,
Whoever gives an honest answer
 Prepare your work outside;
 Be not a witness against your neighbor without cause,
Do not say, “I will do to him as he has done to me;
 I passed by the field of a sluggard,
and behold, it was all overgrown with thorns;
Then I saw and considered it;
 A little sleep, a little slumber,
and poverty will come upon you like a robber,
These also are proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied.
It is the glory of God to conceal things,
As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth,
Take away the dross from the silver,
take away the wicked from the presence of the king,
Do not put yourself forward in the king’s presence
for it is better to be told, “Come up here,”
 do not hastily bring into court,
 Argue your case with your neighbor himself,
lest he who hears you bring shame upon you,
 A word fitly spoken
Like a gold ring or an ornament of gold
Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest
Like clouds and wind without rain
With patience a ruler may be persuaded,
If you have found honey, eat only enough for you,
Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house,
A man who bears false witness against his neighbor
Trusting in a treacherous man in time of trouble
Whoever sings songs to a heavy heart
 If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat,
for you will heap burning coals on his head,
The north wind brings forth rain,
 It is better to live in a corner of the housetop
Like cold water to a thirsty soul,
Like a muddied spring or a polluted fountain
It is not good to eat much honey,
A man without self-control
Like snow in summer or rain in harvest,
Like a sparrow in its flitting, like a swallow in its flying,
 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey,
 Answer not a fool according to his folly,
 Answer a fool according to his folly,
Whoever sends a message by the hand of a fool
Like a lame man’s legs, which hang useless,
Like one who binds the stone in the sling
Like a thorn that goes up into the hand of a drunkard
Like an archer who wounds everyone
Like a dog that returns to his vomit
Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes?
 The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the road!
As a door turns on its hinges,
 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;
The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes
Whoever meddles in a quarrel not his own
Like a madman who throws firebrands, arrows, and death
is the man who deceives his neighbor
For lack of wood the fire goes out,
As charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire,
 The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels;
 Like the glaze covering an earthen vessel
Whoever hates disguises himself with his lips
 when he speaks graciously, believe him not,
though his hatred be covered with deception,
 Whoever digs a pit will fall into it,
A lying tongue hates its victims,
Do not boast about tomorrow,
Let another praise you, and not your own mouth;
A stone is heavy, and sand is weighty,
Wrath is cruel, anger is overwhelming,
 Better is open rebuke
Faithful are the wounds of a friend;
One who is full loathes honey,
Like a bird that strays from its nest
 Oil and perfume make the heart glad,
Do not forsake your friend and your father’s friend,
 Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad,
 The prudent sees danger and hides himself,
 Take a man’s garment when he has put up security for a stranger,
Whoever blesses his neighbor with a loud voice,
 A continual dripping on a rainy day
to restrain her is to restrain the wind
Iron sharpens iron,
 Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit,
As in water face reflects face,
 Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied,
 The crucible is for silver, and the furnace is for gold,
 Crush a fool in a mortar with a pestle
 Know well the condition of your flocks,
for riches do not last forever;
 When the grass is gone and the new growth appears
 the lambs will provide your clothing,
 There will be enough goats’ milk for your food,
 The wicked flee when no one pursues,
When a land transgresses, it has many rulers,
 A poor man who oppresses the poor
Those who forsake the law praise the wicked,
Evil men do not understand justice,
 Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity
The one who keeps the law is a son with understanding,
Whoever multiplies his wealth by interest and profit
If one turns away his ear from hearing the law,
Whoever misleads the upright into an evil way
A rich man is wise in his own eyes,
When the righteous triumph, there is great glory,
Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper,
Blessed is the one who fears the Lord always,
Like a roaring lion or a charging bear
A ruler who lacks understanding is a cruel oppressor,
If one is burdened with the blood of another,
 Whoever walks in integrity will be delivered,
 Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread,
A faithful man will abound with blessings,
To show partiality is not good,
A stingy man hastens after wealth
Whoever rebukes a man will afterward find more favor
Whoever robs his father or his mother
A greedy man stirs up strife,
Whoever trusts in his own mind is a fool,
Whoever gives to the poor will not want,
When the wicked rise, people hide themselves,
 He who is often reproved, yet stiffens his neck,
When the righteous increase, the people rejoice,
He who loves wisdom makes his father glad,
By justice a king builds up the land,
 A man who flatters his neighbor
An evil man is ensnared in his transgression,
A righteous man knows the rights of the poor;
 Scoffers set a city aflame,
If a wise man has an argument with a fool,
Bloodthirsty men hate one who is blameless
A fool gives full vent to his spirit,
If a ruler listens to falsehood,
The poor man and the oppressor meet together;
If a king faithfully judges the poor,
 The rod and reproof give wisdom,
When the wicked increase, transgression increases,
 Discipline your son, and he will give you rest;
Where there is no prophetic vision the people cast off restraint,
By mere words a servant is not disciplined,
Do you see a man who is hasty in his words?
Whoever pampers his servant from childhood
 A man of wrath stirs up strife,
 One’s pride will bring him low,
The partner of a thief hates his own life;
 The fear of man lays a snare,
Many seek the face of a ruler,
 An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous,
The words of Agur son of Jakeh. The oracle.
Surely I am too stupid to be a man.
I have not learned wisdom,
Who has ascended to heaven and come down?
 Every word of God proves true;
 Do not add to his words,
Two things I ask of you;
Remove far from me falsehood and lying;
lest I be full and deny you
 Do not slander a servant to his master,
There are those who curse their fathers
There are those who are clean in their own eyes
There are those—how lofty are their eyes,
There are those whose teeth are swords,
The leech has two daughters:
 Sheol, the barren womb,
The eye that mocks a father
 Three things are too wonderful for me;
the way of an eagle in the sky,
This is the way of an adulteress:
Under three things the earth trembles;
 a slave when he becomes king,
 an unloved woman when she gets a husband,
 Four things on earth are small,
 the ants are a people not strong,
 the rock badgers are a people not mighty,
the locusts have no king,
the lizard you can take in your hands,
 Three things are stately in their tread;
the lion, which is mightiest among beasts
the strutting rooster, the he-goat,
If you have been foolish, exalting yourself,
For pressing milk produces curds,
The words of King Lemuel. An oracle that his mother taught him:
What are you doing, my son? What are you doing, son of my womb?
Do not give your strength to women,
 It is not for kings, O Lemuel,
lest they drink and forget what has been decreed
Give strong drink to the one who is perishing,
 let them drink and forget their poverty
 Open your mouth for the mute,
Open your mouth, judge righteously,
  An excellent wife who can find?
The heart of her husband trusts in her,
She does him good, and not harm,
She seeks wool and flax,
She is like the ships of the merchant;
She rises while it is yet night
She considers a field and buys it;
She dresses herself with strength
She perceives that her merchandise is profitable.
She puts her hands to the distaff,
She opens her hand to the poor
She is not afraid of snow for her household,
She makes bed coverings for herself;
Her husband is known in the gates
She makes linen garments and sells them;
 Strength and dignity are her clothing,
She opens her mouth with wisdom,
She looks well to the ways of her household
Her children rise up and call her blessed;
“Many women have done excellently,
 Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain,
Give her of the fruit of her hands,
