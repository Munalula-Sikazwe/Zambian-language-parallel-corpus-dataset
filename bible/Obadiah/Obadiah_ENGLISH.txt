The vision of Obadiah.
Behold, I will make you small among the nations;
 The pride of your heart has deceived you,
Though you soar aloft like the eagle,
If thieves came to you,
 How Esau has been pillaged,
All your allies have driven you to your border;
 Will I not on that day, declares the Lord,
And your mighty men shall be dismayed, O Teman,
 Because of the violence done to your brother Jacob,
 On the day that you stood aloof,
 But do not gloat over the day of your brother
 Do not enter the gate of my people
 Do not stand at the crossroads
For the day of the Lord is near upon all the nations.
 For as you have drunk on my holy mountain,
 But in Mount Zion there shall be those who escape,
 The house of Jacob shall be a fire,
Those of the Negeb shall possess Mount Esau,
The exiles of this host of the people of Israel
 Saviors shall go up to Mount Zion
