 How lonely sits the city
 She weeps bitterly in the night,
 Judah has gone into exile because of affliction
The roads to Zion mourn,
 Her foes have become the head;
From the daughter of Zion
Jerusalem remembers
 Jerusalem sinned grievously;
Her uncleanness was in her skirts;
The enemy has stretched out his hands
All her people groan
“Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?
“From on high he sent fire;
“My transgressions were bound into a yoke;
“The Lord rejected
“For these things I weep;
 Zion stretches out her hands,
 “The Lord is in the right,
“I called to my lovers,
“Look, O Lord, for I am in distress;
“They heard my groaning,
 “Let all their evildoing come before you,
How the Lord in his anger
The Lord has swallowed up without mercy
He has cut down in fierce anger
 He has bent his bow like an enemy,
 The Lord has become like an enemy;
He has laid waste his booth like a garden,
 The Lord has scorned his altar,
 The Lord determined to lay in ruins
Her gates have sunk into the ground;
The elders of the daughter of Zion
 My eyes are spent with weeping;
They cry to their mothers,
What can I say for you, to what compare you,
 Your prophets have seen for you
All who pass along the way
 All your enemies
The Lord has done what he purposed;
Their heart cried to the Lord.
“Arise, cry out in the night,
Look, O Lord, and see!
In the dust of the streets
You summoned as if to a festival day
 I am the man who has seen affliction
he has driven and brought me
surely against me he turns his hand
He has made my flesh and my skin waste away;
 he has besieged and enveloped me
 he has made me dwell in darkness
 He has walled me about so that I cannot escape;
though I call and cry for help,
 he has blocked my ways with blocks of stones;
 He is a bear lying in wait for me,
 he turned aside my steps and tore me to pieces;
 he bent his bow and set me
He drove into my kidneys
 I have become the laughingstock of all peoples,
 He has filled me with bitterness;
 He has made my teeth grind on gravel,
my soul is bereft of peace;
 so I say, “My endurance has perished;
 Remember my affliction and my wanderings,
My soul continually remembers it
But this I call to mind,
 The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases;
they are new every morning;
 “The Lord is my portion,” says my soul,
The Lord is good to those who wait for him,
 It is good that one should wait quietly
 It is good for a man that he bear
Let him sit alone in silence
 let him put his mouth in the dust—
 let him give his cheek to the one who strikes,
 For the Lord will not
but, though he cause grief, he will have compassion
 for he does not afflict from his heart
To crush underfoot
 to deny a man justice
to subvert a man in his lawsuit,
 Who has spoken and it came to pass,
 Is it not from the mouth of the Most High
 Why should a living man complain,
Let us test and examine our ways,
 Let us lift up our hearts and hands
 “We have transgressed and rebelled,
“You have wrapped yourself with anger and pursued us,
 you have wrapped yourself with a cloud
 You have made us scum and garbage
 “All our enemies
 panic and pitfall have come upon us,
 my eyes flow with rivers of tears
 “My eyes will flow without ceasing,
 until the Lord from heaven
my eyes cause me grief
 “I have been hunted like a bird
 they flung me alive into the pit
 water closed over my head;
 “I called on your name, O Lord,
 you heard my plea, ‘Do not close
 You came near when I called on you;
“You have taken up my cause, O Lord;
You have seen the wrong done to me, O Lord;
You have seen all their vengeance,
 “You have heard their taunts, O Lord,
The lips and thoughts of my assailants
 Behold their sitting and their rising;
 “You will repay them, O Lord,
You will give them dullness of heart;
You will pursue them in anger and destroy them
 How the gold has grown dim,
The precious sons of Zion,
Even jackals offer the breast;
The tongue of the nursing infant sticks
Those who once feasted on delicacies
 For the chastisement of the daughter of my people has been greater
Her princes were purer than snow,
 Now their face is blacker than soot;
Happier were the victims of the sword
 The hands of compassionate women
 The Lord gave full vent to his wrath;
 The kings of the earth did not believe,
This was for the sins of her prophets
 They wandered, blind, through the streets;
“Away! Unclean!” people cried at them.
 The Lord himself has scattered them;
 Our eyes failed, ever watching
 They dogged our steps
Our pursuers were swifter
 The breath of our nostrils, the Lord’s anointed,
 Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom,
 The punishment of your iniquity, O daughter of Zion, is accomplished;
 Remember, O Lord, what has befallen us;
 Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,
We have become orphans, fatherless;
We must pay for the water we drink;
 Our pursuers are at our necks;
We have given the hand to Egypt, and to Assyria,
Our fathers sinned, and are no more;
 Slaves rule over us;
 We get our bread at the peril of our lives,
 Our skin is hot as an oven
Women are raped in Zion,
 Princes are hung up by their hands;
Young men are compelled to grind at the mill,
 The old men have left the city gate,
 The joy of our hearts has ceased;
 The crown has fallen from our head;
For this our heart has become sick,
for Mount Zion which lies desolate;
 But you, O Lord, reign forever;
 Why do you forget us forever,
 Restore us to yourself, O Lord, that we may be restored!
 unless you have utterly rejected us,
