 An oracle concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum of Elkosh.
 The Lord is a jealous and avenging God;
 The Lord is slow to anger and great in power,
 He rebukes the sea and makes it dry;
 The mountains quake before him;
 Who can stand before his indignation?
 The Lord is good,
But with an overflowing flood
What do you plot against the Lord?
For they are like entangled thorns,
From you came one
Thus says the Lord,
And now I will break his yoke from off you
The Lord has given commandment about you:
  Behold, upon the mountains, the feet of him
 The scatterer has come up against you.
For the Lord is restoring the majesty of Jacob
The shield of his mighty men is red;
 The chariots race madly through the streets;
He remembers his officers;
 The river gates are opened;
its mistress is stripped; she is carried off,
 Nineveh is like a pool
Plunder the silver,
 Desolate! Desolation and ruin!
Where is the lionsâ€™ den,
 The lion tore enough for his cubs
 Behold, I am against you, declares the Lord of hosts, and I will burn your chariots in smoke, and the sword shall devour your young lions. I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers shall no longer be heard.
Woe to the bloody city,
The crack of the whip, and rumble of the wheel,
Horsemen charging,
And all for the countless whorings of the prostitute,
 Behold, I am against you,
I will throw filth at you
And all who look at you will shrink from you and say,
 Are you better than Thebes
 Cush was her strength;
 Yet she became an exile;
 You also will be drunken;
All your fortresses are like fig trees
Behold, your troops
 Draw water for the siege;
There will the fire devour you;
You increased your merchants
Your princes are like grasshoppers,
Your shepherds are asleep,
There is no easing your hurt;
