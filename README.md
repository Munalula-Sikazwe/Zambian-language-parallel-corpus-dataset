# Zambian Language Parallel Corpus Dataset
This repository contains a parallel corpus of Zambian languages including English, Bemba, Lozi, Chichewa, Tonga, Mambwe, Luvale, and Lenje. The corpus was created by scraping the bible.com website and includes translations of biblical texts into the various Zambian languages.

Contents
The corpus is provided in a machine-readable format and includes 30923 lines. Each line includes a translation in English and one of the Zambian languages.

Usage
This corpus can be used for a variety of NLP tasks, including machine translation, cross-lingual information retrieval, and multilingual natural language processing. The corpus can be used to perform tasks such as cross-lingual text classification and named entity recognition.

Limitations
Please note that while this corpus is a great starting point, it may not be sufficient to train a machine translation model as it may not contain enough data.
